["* Stephen Dedalus called it \"a nightmare from which I am trying to awake\". If we think of Kierkegaard, of Nietzsche, of H\u00f6lderlin, we see them standing alone, outside of history. They are spotlighted by their intensity, and the background is all darkness. They intersect history, but are not a part of it. There is something anti-history about such men; they are not subject to time, accident and death, but their intensity is a protest against it. I have elsewhere called such men \"Outsiders\" because they attempt to stand outside history. which defines humanity on terms of limitation, not of possibility."]
