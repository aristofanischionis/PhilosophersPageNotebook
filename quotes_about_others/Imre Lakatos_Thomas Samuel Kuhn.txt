["* Kuhn as does Popper rejects the idea that science grows by accumulation of eternal truths.. But while according to Popper science is \u2018revolution in permanence\u2019, and criticism the heart of the scienti\ufb01c enterprise, according to Kuhn revolution is exceptional and, indeed, extra-scienti\ufb01c, and criticism is, in \u2018normal\u2019 times, anathema... The clash between Popper and Kuhn is not about a mere technical point in epistemology. It concerns our central intellectual values, and has implications not only for theoretical physics but also for the underdeveloped social sciences and even for moral and political philosophy. If even in science there is no other way of judging a theory but by assessing the number, faith and vocal energy of its supporters, then this must be even more so in the social sciences: truth lies in power. Thus Kuhn\u2019s position would vindicate, no doubt, unintentionally, the basic political credo of contemporary religious maniacs (\u2018student revolutionaries\u2019)."]
