["* Verse no longer stands at the centre of communicative discourse.  It is no longer, as it was from Milton, the natural repository of knowledge and traditional sentiment.  It no longer gives to society its main record of past grandeur or its natural setting for prophecy, as it did in Dante.  Verse has grown private.  It is a special language which the individual poet insinuates, by force of personal genius, into the awareness of his contemporaries, persuading to learn and perhaps hand on his own uses of words.  Poetry has become essentially lyric \u2014 that is to say, it is the poetry of private vision rather than of public or of national occasion."]
