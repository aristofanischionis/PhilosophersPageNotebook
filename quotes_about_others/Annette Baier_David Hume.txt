["* I think there is at least one moral theory of respectable lineage and good independent credentials that can accommodate such fairly minimal intuitions about us and animals. This is the theory Hume offers us. I do not consider Hume a forerunner of Mill, to be offering us a theory about human virtues, not a theory about utility maximization and the duties that might involve.", "* Hume describes (E, 235) as a \u201cfancied monster\u201d a man who has \u201cno manner of concern to his fellow-creatures but to regard the happiness and misery of all sensible beings with greater indifference than even two contiguous shades of the same color\u201d (ibid.). To limit ones concern to those sensible beings who are of ones own species is to be part-monster, but such monsters, alas, are not merely fancied ones."]
