["* Verse no longer stands at the centre of communicative discourse.  It is no longer, as it was from Milton, the natural repository of knowledge and traditional sentiment.  It no longer gives to society its main record of past grandeur or its natural setting for prophecy, as it did in Dante.  Verse has grown private.  It is a special language which the individual poet insinuates, by force of personal genius, into the awareness of his contemporaries, persuading to learn and perhaps hand on his own uses of words.  Poetry has become essentially lyric \u2014 that is to say, it is the poetry of private vision rather than of public or of national occasion.", "*  Even where it is manipulated by major talents, deconstruction tends to bear either on marginal texts (Sade, Lautr\u00e9amont), or on secondary work by a great writer (Barthes on Balzacs Sarrazine).  The classics of deconstruction, in Paul De Man, are \"misreadings\" not of literature but of philosophy; they address themselves to philosophical linguistics and the theory of language.  The masks they seek to strip off are those worn by Plato, by Hegel, by Rousseau, by  Nietszche or Saussure. Deconstruction has nothing to tell us of Dante, of Shakespeare or Tolstoy."]
