["* True contemplation considers Reality (or Being) in its manifestations as well as in its origin. If this is remembered, there need be no conflict between social morality and the inner life. Eckhart recognises that it is a harder and a nobler task to preserve detachment in a crowd than in a cell; the little daily sacrifices of family life are often a greater trial than selfimposed mortifications. \"We need not destroy any little good in ourselves for the sake of a better, but we should strive to grasp every truth in its highest meaning, for no one good contradicts another.\" \"Love God, and do as you like, say the Free Spirits. Yes; but as long as you like anything contrary to Gods will, you do not love Him.\"  There is much more of the same kind in Eckharts sermons \u2014 as good and sensible doctrine as one could find anywhere."]
