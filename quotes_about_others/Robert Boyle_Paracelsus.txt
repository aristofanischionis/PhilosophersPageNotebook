For, as I told you long since, I am not Obligd to examine private mens writings, (which were a Labour as endless as unprofitable) being only engagd to examine those Opinions about the Tria Prima, which I find those Chymists I have met with to agree in most: And I Doubt not but my Arguments against their Doctrine will be in great part easily enough applicable evn to those private Opinions, which they do not so directly and expresly oppose."]
