["* As man loses touch with his inner being, his instinctive depths, he finds himself trapped in the world of consciousness, that is to say, in the world of other people. Any poet knows this truth; when other people sicken him, he turns to hidden resources of power inside himself, and he knows then that other people dont matter a damn. He knows the secret life inside him is the reality; other people are mere shadows in comparison. but the shadows themselves cling to one another. Man is a political animal, said stars, than with other men."]
