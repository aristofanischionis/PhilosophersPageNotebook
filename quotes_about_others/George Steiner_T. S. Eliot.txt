["* Almost alone among cognitive-aesthetic movements and strategies of interpretation, deconstruction neither champions any body of past literature or art, nor does it act as vanguard or advocate for any contemporary or incipient school.  The New Criticism and T. S. Eliot strove for the revaluation of Metaphysical poetry so as to underwrite, in turn, certain tactics of modenity.  Aristotle was advocate for Sophocles.  Deconstruction is, intentionally, marginal (a key trope) to all histories of taste and manifestos for innovation."]
