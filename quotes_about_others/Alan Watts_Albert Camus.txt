["*Camus {{Anchor|five_questions}}said there is only really one serious philosophical question, which is whether or not to commit suicide. I think there are four or five serious philosophical questions: The first one is: Who started it? The second is: Are we going to make it? The third is: Where are we going to put it? The fourth is: Whos going to clean up? And the fifth: Is it serious?"]
