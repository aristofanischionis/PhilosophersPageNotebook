["* I agree with Mr Wolf that freedom is centrally important. But how should we see the demands of freedom when habit-forming behaviour today restricts the freedom of the same person in the future? Once acquired, the habit of smoking is hard to kick, and it can be asked, with some plausibility, whether youthful smokers have an unqualified right to place their future selves in such bondage.A similar issue was addressed by the leading apostle of liberty, John Stuart Mill, when he argued against a person\u2019s freedom to sell himself or herself in slavery. [\u2026] Another question to ask is: who exactly are the \u201cothers\u201d who are affected? Passive smokers are not the only people who might be harmed. If smokers are made ill by their decision to go on smoking, then the society can either take the view that these victims of self-choice have no claim to public resources (such as the National Health Service or social safety nets), or more leniently (and I believe more reasonably) it could accept that these people still qualify to get social help. If the former, we would live in a monstrously unforgiving society; and happily I do not see Britain or France going that way. If the latter, then the interests of \u201cothers\u201d would surely be affected through the sharing of the costs of public services."]
