["* It may seem to be a long way from Blakes innocent talk of love and copulation to De Sades need to inflict pain. And yet both are the outcome of a sexual mysticism that strives to transcend the everyday world. Simone de Beauvoir said penetratingly of De Sades work that he is trying to communicate an experience whose distinguishing characteristic is, nevertheless its will to remain incommunicable. De Sades perversion may have sprung from his dislike of his mother or of other women, but its basis is a kind of distorted religious emotion.", "* If space in infinite, how about the space inside man? Blake said that eternity opens from the center of an atom. My former terror vanished. Now I saw that I was mistaken in thinking of myself as an object in a dead landscape. I had been assuming that man is limited because his brain is limited, that only so much can be packed into the portmanteau. But the spaces of the mind are a new dimension. The body is a mere wall between two infinities. Space extends to infinity outwards; the mind stretches to infinity inwards."]
