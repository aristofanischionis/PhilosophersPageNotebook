["* Leo Tolstoys life has been devoted to replacing the method of violence for removing tyranny or securing reform by the method of non\u00adresistance to evil. He would meet hatred expressed in violence by love expressed in self\u00adsuffering. He admits of no exception to whittle down this great and divine law of love. He applies it to all the problems that trouble mankind."]
