["* If [...] the ability to tell right from wrong should turn out to have anything to do with the ability to think, then we must be able to \"demand\" its exercise from every sane person, no matter how erudite or ignorant, intelligent or stupid, he may happen to be. Kant\u2014in this respect almost alone among the philosophers\u2014was much bothered by the common opinion that philosophy is only for the few, precisely because of its moral implications.", "* Kant ... discovered \u201cthe scandal of reason,\u201d that is the fact that our mind is not capable of certain and verifiable knowledge regarding matters and questions that it nevertheless cannot help thinking about.", "* Kant  was also quite aware that \"the urgent need\" of reason is both different from and \"more than mere quest and desire for knowledge.\" Hence, the distinguishing of the two faculties, reason and intellect, coincides with a distinction between two altogether different mental activities, thinking and knowing.", "* Kant stated defensively that he had \"found it necessary to deny knowledge. . . to make room for faith,\" but he had not made room for faith; he had made room for thought, and he had not \"denied knowledge\" but separated knowledge from thinking."]
