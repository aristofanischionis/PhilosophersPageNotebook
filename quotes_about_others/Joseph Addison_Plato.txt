["* It must be so \u2014 Plato, thou reasonest well!  Else whence this pleasing hope, this fond desire,  This longing after immortality?  Or whence this secret dread, and inward horror,  O falling into nought? Why shrinks the soul  Back on herself, and startles at destruction?  Tis the divinity that stirs within us;   Tis heaven itself, that points out an hereafter,  And intimates eternity to man."]
