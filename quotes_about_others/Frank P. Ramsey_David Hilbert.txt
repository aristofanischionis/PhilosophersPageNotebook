["* [T]he formalist school, of whom the most eminent representative is Hilbert, have concentrated on the propositions of mathematics, such as 2 + 2 = 4. They have pronounced these to be meaningless formulae to be manipulated according to arbitrary rules, and they hold that mathematical knowledge consists in knowing what formulae can be derived from what others consistently with the rules. ...for example...2 is a meaningless mark occurring in these meaningless formulae. But... 2 occurs not only in 2 + 2 = 4, but also in It is 2 miles to the station, which is not a meaningless formulae, but a significant proposition, in which 2 cannot conceivably be a meaningless mark."]
