["** One of the statements presenting what has become known as \"Moores paradox, from a famous lecture concerning logical inconsistency in 1942, as quoted in Reason in Theory and Practice  (1969) by Roy Edgley, p. 71;  in which he also stated \"It is not raining, but I believe that it is.\" These sentences are not logically contradictory, and yet it seems that no one could make a true assertion by sincerely speaking them. It is reported that Ludwig Wittgenstein, on hearing of Moores lecture, went to Moores house in the middle of the night to ask him to repeat it, and considered the problems presented by it Moores greatest contributions to philosophy."]
