["* And Im going on in believing in Him. Youd better know Him, and know His name, and know how to call His name. You may not know philosophy. You may not be able to say with Alfred North Whitehead that Hes the Principle of Concretion. You may not be able to say with Hegel and Spinoza that He is the Absolute Whole. You may not be able to say with Plato that Hes the Architectonic Good. You may not be able to say with Aristotle that Hes the Unmoved Mover. But sometimes you can get poetic about it if you know Him. You begin to know that our brothers and sisters in distant days were right. Because they did know Him as a rock in a weary land, as a shelter in the time of starving, as my water when Im thirsty, and then my bread in a starving land. And then if you cant even say that, sometimes you may have to say, \"Hes my everything. Hes my sister and my brother. Hes my mother and my father.\" If you believe it and know it, you never need walk in darkness. Dont be a fool. Recognize your dependence on God. As the days become dark and the nights become dreary, realize that there is a God who rules above. And so Im not worried about tomorrow. I get weary every now and then. The future looks difficult and dim, but Im not worried about it ultimately because I have faith in God."]
