["* Diogenes received an invitation to dine with one whose house was splendidly furnished, in the highest order and taste, and nothing therein wanting. Diogenes, hawking, and as if about to spit, looked in all directions, and finding nothing adapted thereto, spat right in the face of the master. He, indignant, asked why he did so? \"Because,\" Diogenes, \"I saw nothing so dirty and filthy in all your house. For the walls were covered with pictures, the floors of the most precious tessellated character \u2014 and ranged with the various images of gods, and other ornamental figures.\"", "* Diogenes the Cynic, it is related, was mighty of all sexual lusts, not associating it with pleasure, an attractive good thing to some, but because of the harm that the retention of semen would cause if he avoided the habit of releasing it. When a prostitute who promised to visit him was delayed for some time, he rubbed his genitals with his hand, ejecting semen. After the whore arrived, he sent her away, saying: \"my hand celebrated the wedding-hymn first.\" But it is clearly correct that, likewise, the disciplined man does not on account of pleasure indulge in lusts, but in order to relieve the hindrance acting as if this was not associated with pleasure.", "* Diogenes compared them to fig-trees growing over precipices; for their fruit was devoured by daws and crows, not by men."]
