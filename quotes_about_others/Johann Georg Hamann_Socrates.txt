["* Let us assume that we invited an unknown person to a game of cards. If this person answered us, \u201cI don\u2019t play,\u201d we would either interpret this to mean that he did not understand the game, or that he had an aversion to it which arose from economic, ethical, or other reasons. Let us imagine, however, that an honorable man, who was known to possess every possible skill in the game, and who was well versed in its rules and its forbidden tricks, but who could like a game and participate in it only when it was an innocent pastime, were invited into a company of clever swindlers, who were known as good players and to whom he was equal on both scores, to join them in a game. If he said, \u201cI do not play,\u201d we would have to join him in looking the people with whom he was talking straight in the face, and would be able to supplement his words as follows: \u201cI don\u2019t play, that is, with people such as you, who break the rules of the game, and rob it of its pleasure. If you offer to play a game, our mutual agreement, then, is that we recognize the capriciousness of chance as our master; and you call the science of your nimble fingers chance, and I must accept it as such, it I will, or run the risk of insulting you or choose the shame of imitating you.\u201d \u2026 The opinion of Socrates can be summarized in these blunt words, when he said to the Sophists, the leaned men of his time, \u201cI know nothing.\u201d Therefore these words were a thorn in their eyes and a scourge on their backs."]
