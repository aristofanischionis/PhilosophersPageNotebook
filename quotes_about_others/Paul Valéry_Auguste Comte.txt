Teste was conceived \u2014 in a room where Auguste Comte spent his early years \u2014 at a period when I was drunk on my own will and subject to strange excesses of consciousness of my self.  I was suffering from the acute ailment called precision. I tended toward the extreme of the reckless desire to understand, and I searched in myself for the critical points in my powers of attention."]
