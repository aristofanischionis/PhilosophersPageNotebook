["* Mass education was designed to turn independent farmers into docile, passive tools of production. That was its primary purpose. And dont think people didnt know it. They knew it and they fought against it. There was a lot of resistance to mass education for exactly that reason. It was also understood by the elites. Emerson once said something about how were educating them to keep them from our throats. If you dont educate them, what we call \"education,\" theyre going to take control -- \"they\" being what Alexander Hamilton called the \"great beast,\" namely the people. The anti-democratic thrust of opinion in what are called democratic societies is really ferocious. And for good reason. Because the freer the society gets, the more dangerous the great beast becomes and the more you have to be careful to cage it somehow."]
