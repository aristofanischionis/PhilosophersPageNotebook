["*The most immediate result of this unbalanced specialisation has been that to-day, when there are more \"scientists\" than ever, there are much less \"cultured\" men than, for example, about 1750. And the worst is that with these turnspits of science not even the real progress of science itself is assured. For science needs from time to time, as a necessary regulator of its own advance, a labour of reconstitution, and, as I have said, this demands an effort towards unification, which grows more and more difficult, involving, as it does, ever-vaster regions of the world of knowledge. Newton was able to found his system of physics without knowing much philosophy, but Einstein needed to saturate himself with Kant and Mach before he could reach his own keen synthesis. Kant and Mach \u2014 the names are mere symbols of the enormous mass of philosophic and psychological thought which has influenced Einstein."]
