["* Now that isnt the only thing that convinces me that weve strayed away from this attitude, this principle. The other thing is that we have adopted a sort of a pragmatic test for right and wrong \u2014 whatever works is right. If it works, its all right. Nothing is wrong but that which does not work. If you dont get caught, its right. ... Thats the attitude, isnt it? Its all right to disobey the Ten Commandments, but just dont disobey the eleventh, \"Thou shall not get caught.\" ... Thats the attitude. Thats the prevailing attitude in our culture. No matter what you do, just do it with a bit of finesse. You know, a sort of attitude of the survival of the slickest. Not the Darwinian survival of the fittest, but the survival of the slickest \u2014 whoever can be the slickest is the one who right. Its all right to lie, but lie with dignity. ... Its all right to steal and to rob and extort, but do it with a bit of finesse. Its even all right to hate, but just dress your hate up in the garments of love and make it appear that you are loving when you are actually hating. Just get by! Thats the thing thats right according to this new ethic. My friends, that attitude is destroying the soul of our culture! Its destroying our nation! The thing that we need in the world today is a group of men and women who will stand up for right and to be opposed to wrong, wherever it is."]
