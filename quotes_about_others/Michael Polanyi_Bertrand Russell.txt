["* Whitehead and Russell ... translate \\vdash p imples q into the words it is asserted that p implies q&#39;. But the phrase it is asserted suggests an impersonal happening of assertions: it is asserted as it is raining or it happens. The value of the assertion sign is lost if we allow ourselves to revert in our verbal translation of it to the muddle of a declaratory sentence which asserts itself or is impersonally asserted by nobody in particular."]
