["* The kind of equality utilitarianism supports is given by Bentham\u2019s formula...: \u2018everybody to count for one, and nobody for more than one\u2019...Utilitarianism seeks to maximize happiness, and in deciding how to calculate whether happiness is being maximized, no one\u2019s pleasures or pains should count for less because they are peasants rather than aristocrats, slaves rather than slave-owners, Africans rather than Europeans, poor rather than rich, illiterates rather than doctors of philosophy, children rather than adults, females rather than males, or even, as we have seen, non-human animals rather than human beings."]
