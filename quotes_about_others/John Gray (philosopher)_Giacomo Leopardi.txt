["* In Leopardi\u2019s view, the universal claims of Freud a hundred years later \u2013 did not share this view. The crimes of medieval Christendom were worse than those of antiquity, he believed, precisely because they could be defended as applying universal principles: the villainy introduced into the world by Christianity was \u2018entirely new and more terrible \u2026 more horrible and more barbarous than that of antiquity\u2019. Modern rationalism renews the central error of Christianity \u2013 the claim to have revealed the good life for all of humankind. Leopardi described the secular creeds that emerged in modern times as expressions of \u2018half-philosophy\u2019, a type of thinking with many of the defects of religion. What Leopardi called \u2018the barbarism of reason\u2019 \u2013 the project of remaking the world on a more rational model \u2013 was the militant evangelism of Christianity in a more dangerous form. Events have confirmed Leopardi\u2019s diagnosis. As Christianity has waned, the intolerance it bequeathed to the world has only grown more destructive. From imperialism through communism and incessant wars launched to promote democracy and human rights, the most barbarous forms of violence have been promoted as means to a higher civilization."]
