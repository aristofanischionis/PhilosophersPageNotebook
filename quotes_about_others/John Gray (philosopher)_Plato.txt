["* Philosophers have always tried to show that we are not like other animals, sniffing their way uncertainly through the world.  Yet after all the work of Spinoza, Descartes and Bertrand Russell we have no more reason than other animals do for believing that the sun will rise tomorrow.", "* It is significant that nothing resembling Platonism arose in China. Classical Chinese script is not ideographic, as used to be thought; but because of what A.C. Graham terms its combination of graphic wealth with phonetic poverty it did not encourage the kind of abstract thinking that produced Platos philosophy. Plato was what historians of philosophy call a realist - he believed that abstract terms designated spiritual or intellectual entities. In contrast, throughout its long history, Chinese thought has been nominalist - it has understood that even the most abstract terms are only labels, names for the diversity of things in the world. As a result, Chinese thinkers have rarely mistaken ideas for facts. Platos legacy to European thought was a trio of capital letters - the Good, the Beautiful and the True. Wars have been fought and tyrannies established, cultures have been ravaged and peoples exterminated in the service of these abstractions. Europe owes much of its murderous history to errors of thinking engendered by the alphabet.", "* The heterodox current in immortal Paul and Augustine, which was strongly influenced by Plato, immortality meant something quite different \u2013 a life out of time, enjoyed by the \u2018soul\u2019 or \u2018spirit\u2019 of the departed. How this Platonic immortality could preserve anything like the persons that once lived was not made clear."]
