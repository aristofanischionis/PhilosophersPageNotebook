["* Science does not give Don Quixote what he demands of it. \"Then let him not make the demand,\" it will be said, \"let him resign himself, let him accept life and truth as they are.\" But he does not accept them as they are, and he asks for signs, urged thereto by Sancho, who stands by his side. And it is not that Don Quixote does not understand what those understand who talk thus to him, those who succeed in resigning themselves and accepting rational life and rational truth. No, it is that the needs of his heart are greater. Pedantry? Who knows!... And he wishes, unhappy man, to rationalize the irrational and irrationalize the rational. And he sinks into despair of the critical century whose two greatest victims were Nietzsche and Tolstoi. And through this despair he reaches the heroic fury of which Giordano Bruno spoke \u2014 that intellectual Don Quixote who escaped from the cloister \u2014 and became an awakener of sleeping souls (dormitantium animorum excubitor), as the ex-Dominican said of himself \u2014 he who wrote: \"Heroic love is the property of those superior natures who are called insane (insano) not because they do not know, but because they over-know (soprasanno).\""]
