["* It took centuries of intellectual, philosophical development to achieve political Founding Fathers. The system they established was not based on unlimited majority rule, but on its opposite: on individual rights, which were not to be alienated by majority vote or minority plotting. The individual was not left at the mercy of his neighbors or his leaders: the Constitutional system of checks and balances was scientifically devised to protect him from both. This was the great American achievement\u2014and if concern for the actual welfare of other nations were our present leaders motive, this is what we should have been teaching the world."]
