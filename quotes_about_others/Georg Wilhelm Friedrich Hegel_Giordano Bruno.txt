["*This is Brunos fundamental idea. He says: \u201dTo recognize this unity of form and matter in all things, is what reason is striving to attain to. But in order to penetrate to this unity, in order to investigate all the secrets of Nature, we must search into the opposed and contradictory extremes of things, the maximum and the minimum\u201d It is in these very extremes that they are intelligible, and become united in the Notion; and this union of them is infinite Nature. \u201cTo find the point of union is not the greatest matter; but to develop from, the same its very opposite, this is the real and the deepest secret of the art\u201d It is saying much if we speak of knowing the development of the Idea as a necessity of determinations; we shall see later how Bruno proceeded to do this. He represents the original principle, which is elsewhere known as the form, under the Notion of the minimum, which is at the same time the maximum One, which at the same time is All; the universe is this One in All."]
