["* Someone said that it is important \u2014 you cannot live without it \u2014 exactly because it is useless. As Heidegger put it in a famous sentence: \"Science doesnt think\" \u2014 precisely because it is useful, it works toward goals that it doesn\u2019t choose. In Kantian terms, science deals with phenomena, factual data that it receives according to reason\u2019s frames, organizes them in time and space, expresses them mathematically, connects and measures them in various ways. But Kant says that there is the noumenon beyond the phenomenon: what you can think but is phenomenologically unknown. It is part of what Kant calls the \"Kingdom of Ends\". In this kingdom you encounter freedom; that is something impossible to know phenomenologically. The same goes for the existence of God. In philosophy, there are higher questions that usually don\u2019t have an answer because they do not concern phenomenal data, the way science does. This is the source of a peculiar feeling of uselessness and void-ness about philosophy. But we cannot live without it if we don\u2019t want to become machines or robots."]
