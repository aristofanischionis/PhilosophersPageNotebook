["* To shoot a man because one disagrees with his interpretation of Darwin or Hegel is a sinister tribute to the supremacy of ideas in human affairs \u2014 but a tribute nevertheless.", "*  Even where it is manipulated by major talents, deconstruction tends to bear either on marginal texts (Sade, Lautr\u00e9amont), or on secondary work by a great writer (Barthes on Balzacs Sarrazine).  The classics of deconstruction, in Paul De Man, are \"misreadings\" not of literature but of philosophy; they address themselves to philosophical linguistics and the theory of language.  The masks they seek to strip off are those worn by Plato, by Hegel, by Rousseau, by  Nietszche or Saussure. Deconstruction has nothing to tell us of Dante, of Shakespeare or Tolstoy."]
