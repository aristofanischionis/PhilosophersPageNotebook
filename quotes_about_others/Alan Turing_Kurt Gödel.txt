["* The \"computable\" numbers may be described briefly as the real numbers whose expressions as a decimal are calculable by finite means. ...According to my definition, a number is computable if its decimal can be written down by a machine. ...I show that certain large classes of numbers are computable. They include, for instance, the real parts of all {{w|algebraic number}}s, the real parts of the zeros of the \u03c0, e, etc. The computable numbers do not, however, include all definable numbers. ...[C]onclusions are reached which are superficially similar to those of G\u00f6del. ...[I]t is shown ...that the Hilbertian {{w|Entscheidungsproblem}} can have no solution. In a recent paper {{w|Alonzo Church}}...  reaches similar conclusions..."]
