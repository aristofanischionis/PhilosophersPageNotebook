["* While Catholics were murdering Protestants in France, and Protestants, under Elizabeth, were murdering Catholics in England, and the Inquisition was killing and robbing Jews in Spain, and Bruno was being burned at the stake in Italy, Akbar invited the representatives of all the religions in his empire to a conference, pledged them to peace, issued edicts of toleration for every cult and creed, and, as evidence of his own neutrality, married wives from the Brahman, Buddhist, and Mohammedan faiths.  His greatest pleasure, after the fires of youth had cooled, was in the free discussion of religious beliefs. \u2026\u00a0The King took no stock in revelations, and would accept nothing that could not justify itself with science and philosophy. It was not unusual for him to gather friends and prelates of various sects together, and discuss religion with them from Thursday evening to Friday noon. When the Moslem mullahs and the Christian priests quarreled he reproved them both, saying that God should be worshiped through the intellect, and not by a blind adherence to supposed revelations. \"Each person,\" he said, in the spirit \u2014 and perhaps through the influence \u2014 of the Upanishads and Kabir, \"according to his condition gives the Supreme Being a name; but in reality to name the Unknowable is vain.\""]
