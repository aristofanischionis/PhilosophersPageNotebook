["* There is something for which Newton \u2014 or better to say not Newton alone, but modern science in general \u2014 can still be made responsible: it is splitting of our world in two. I have been saying that modern science broke down the barriers that separated the heavens and the earth, and that it united and unified the universe. And that is true. But, as I have said, too, it did this by substituting for our world of quality and sense perception, the world in which we live, and love, and die, another world \u2014 the world of quantity, or reified geometry, a world in which, though there is place for everything, there is no place for man. Thus the world of science \u2014 the real world \u2014 became estranged and utterly divorced from the world of life, which science has been unable to explain \u2014 not even to explain away by calling it \"subjective\".  True, these worlds are everyday \u2014 and even more and more \u2014 connected by praxis. Yet for theory they are divided by an abyss.  Two worlds: this means two truths. Or no truth at all.  This is the tragedy of the modern mind which \"solved the riddle of the universe,\" but only to replace it by another riddle: the riddle of itself."]
