["* First, the physicists in the persons of Faraday and Maxwell, proposed the \"electromagnetic field\" in contradistinction to matter, as a reality of a different category. Then, during the last century, the mathematicians, \u2026 secretly undermined belief in the evidence of Euclidean Geometry. And now, in our time, there has been unloosed a cataclysm which has swept away space, time, and matter hitherto regarded as the firmest pillars of natural science, but only to make place for a view of things of wider scope and entailing a deeper vision. This revolution was promoted essentially by the thought of one man, Albert Einstein."]
