["* I am not very impressed with theological arguments whatever they may be used to support. Such arguments have often been found unsatisfactory in the past.  In the time of Galileo it was argued that the texts, \"And the sun stood still... and hasted not to go down about a whole day\" (Joshua x. 13) and \"He laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not move at any time\" (Psalm cv. 5) were an adequate refutation of the Copernican theory."]
