["* Claudius Ptolemys great contribution to astronomy was his famous work the Almagest, which presented formally the astronomical theories of the day that had evolved from the great debates within the different Greek philosophical schools. Claudius Ptolemy freely admitted that he had contributed little original research to the treatise but rather had based his conclusions principally on the work of Hipparchus. ...Ptolemy did not claim that his cosmological model described the actual conditions. It simply reproduced geometrically the observed motions of the known heavenly bodies and enabled their positions to be easily predicted for any particular time. \u2026 Copernicus heliocentric theory had replaced the Ptolemaic system, many astronomers used Ptolemys model to predict the motion of the planets, since its intricate calculations produced more accurate values."]
