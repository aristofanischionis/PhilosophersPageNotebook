["* In aesthetic discourse, no interpretative-critical analysis, doctrine or programme is superseded, is erased, by any later construction.  The Copernican theory did correct and supersede that of Ptolemy.  The chemistry of Lavoisier makes untenable the early phlogiston  theory.  Aristotle on mimesis and pathos is not superseded by Lessing or Bergson.  The Surrealist manifestos of Breton do not cancel out Popes Essay on Criticism though they may well be antithetical to it."]
