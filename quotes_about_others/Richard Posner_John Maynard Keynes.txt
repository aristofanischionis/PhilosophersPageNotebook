["* Correctly anticipating the rapid growth of living standards, moreover, Keynes predicted that within a century peoples material wants would be satiated, and so per capita consumption would stop growing. People would work less, but only because their need for income, and more important their desire for it, was less. And then the challenge to society would be the management of unprecedented voluntary leisure. This was a popular 1930s theme--think of Huxleys Brave New World--but it underestimated the ability of business to create new wants, and new goods and services to fulfill them.", "* Although there are other heresies in The General Theory, along with puzzles, opacities, loose ends, confusions, errors, exaggerations, and anachronisms galore, they do not detract from the books Keyness masterpiece is many things, but \"outdated\" it is not."]
