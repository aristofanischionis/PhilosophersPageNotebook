["* Being, in whose name Heidegger\u2019s philosophy increasingly concentrates itself, is for him\u2014as a pure self-presentation to passive consciousness\u2014just as immediate, just as independent of the mediations of the subject as the facts and the sensory data are for the positivists. In both philosophical movements thinking becomes a necessary evil and is broadly discredited. Thinking loses its element of independence. The autonomy of reason vanishes: the part of reason that exceeds the subordinate reflection upon and adjustment to pre-given data. With it, however, goes the conception of freedom and, potentially, the self-determination of human society."]
