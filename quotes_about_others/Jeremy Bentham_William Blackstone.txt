["*It is part of a work to which if ever it should be completed I\u00a0intend to give some such title as Principles of Legal Policy; the object of it is to trace out a new model for the Laws:\u00a0of my own country you may imagine, in the first place:\u00a0but keeping those of other countries all along in view.
