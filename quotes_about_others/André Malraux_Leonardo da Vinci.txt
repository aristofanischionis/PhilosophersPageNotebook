["* Once the masterpiece has emerged, the lesser works surrounding it fall into place; and it then gives the impression of having been led up to and foreseeable, though actually it is inconceivable \u2014 or, rather, it can only be conceived of once it is there for us to see it. It is not a scene that has come alive, but a latent potentiality that has materialized. Suppose that one of the worlds masterpieces were to disappear, leaving no trace behind it, not even a reproduction; even the completest knowledge of its makers other works would not enable the next generation to visualize it.  All the rest of Leonardos oeuvre would not enable us to visualize the Mona Lisa; all Rembrandts, the Three Crosses or The Prodigal Son; all Vermeers, The Love Letter; all Watteaus other works conjure up LEnseigne de Gersaint, had it disappeared?"]
