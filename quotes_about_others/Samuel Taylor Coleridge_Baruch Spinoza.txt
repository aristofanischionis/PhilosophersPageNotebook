["* Shakespeare is the Spinosistic deity \u2014 an omnipresent creativeness. Milton is the deity of prescience; he stands ab extra, and drives a fiery chariot and four, making the horses feel the iron curb which holds them in. Shakspeares poetry is characterless; that is, it does not reflect the individual Shakspeare; but John Milton himself is in every line of the Paradise Lost. Shakspeares rhymed verses are excessively condensed, \u2014 epigrams with the point every where; but in his blank dramatic verse he is diffused, with a linked sweetness long drawn out."]
