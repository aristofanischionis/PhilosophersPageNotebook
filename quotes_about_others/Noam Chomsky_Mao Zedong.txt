["* Reform is a word you always ought to watch out for. Like, when Mao started the Cultural Revolution it wasnt called a reform. Reform is a change that youre supposed to like. So as soon as you hear the word reform you can reach for your wallet and see whos lifting it. [...] Subsidy is another interesting word, kind of like reform. Its a subsidy if public funds are used for public purposes. Thats called a subsidy. Its not called a subsidy when it goes to private wealth. Thats reform or something."]
