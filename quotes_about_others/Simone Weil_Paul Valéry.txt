["* During the last quarter of a century all the authority associated with the function of spiritual guidance \u2026 has seeped down into the lowest publications. \u2026 Between a poem by Val\u00e9ry and an advertisement for a beauty cream promising a rich marriage to anyone who used it there was at no point a breach of continuity. So as a result of literature\u2019s spiritual usurpation a beauty cream advertisement possessed, in the eyes of little village girls, the authority that was formerly attached to the words of priests.", "* Such words as spontaneity, sincerity, gratuitousness, richness, enrichment \u2014 words which imply an almost total indifference to contrasts of value \u2014 have come more often from their [the surrealists\u2019] pens than words which contain a reference to good and evil. Moreover, this latter class of words has become degraded, especially those which refer to the good, as Val\u00e9ry remarked some years ago. Words like virtue, nobility, honor, honesty, generosity, have become almost impossible to use or else they have acquired bastard meanings; language is no longer equipped for legitimately praising a man\u2019s character."]
