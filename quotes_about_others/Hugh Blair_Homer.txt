["* Popes translation only. An excellent poetical performance that translation is, and faithful in the main to the original. In some places, it may be thought to have even improved Homer. It has certainly softened some of his rudenesses, and added delicacy and grace to some of his sentiments. But withal, it is no other than Homer modernised. In the midst of the elegance and luxuriancy of Mr. Popes language, we lose sight of the old bards simplicity. I know indeed no author, to whom it is more difficult to do justice in a translation, than Homer."]
