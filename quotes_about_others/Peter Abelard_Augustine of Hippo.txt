["* There are many seeming contradictions and even obscurities in the innumerable writings of the church fathers. Our Augustine confesses in his own case, the fathers ventured to rely upon the opinions of others.", "* Doubtless the fathers might Augustine found himself mistaken in some cases and did not hesitate to retract his errors. He warns his admirers not to look upon his letters as they would upon the Scriptures, but to accept only those things which, upon examination, they find to be true.  All writings belonging to this class are to be read with full freedom to criticize, and with no obligation to accept unquestioningly; otherwise they way would be blocked to all discussion, and posterity be deprived of the excellent intellectual exercise of debating difficult questions of language and presentation."]
