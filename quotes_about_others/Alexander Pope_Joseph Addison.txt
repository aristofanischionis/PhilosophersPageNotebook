["* The famous Lord Hallifax (though so much talked of) was rather a pretender to taste, than really possessed of it.\u2014When I had finished the two or three first books of my translation of the Iliad, that lord, \"desired to have the pleasure of hearing them read at his house.\" Addison, Congreve, and Garth, were there at the reading.\u2014In four or five places, Lord Hallifax stopped me very civilly; and with a speech, each time of much the same kind: \"I beg your pardon, Mr. Pope, but there is something in that passage that does not quite please me.\u2014Be so good as to mark the place, and consider it a little at your leisure.\u2014I am sure you can give it a little turn.\"\u2014I returned from Lord Hallifaxs with Dr. Garth, in his chariot; and as we were going along, was saying to the doctor, that my lord had laid me under a good deal of difficulty, by such loose and general observations; that I had been thinking over the passages almost ever since, and could not guess at what it was that offended his lordship in either of them.\u2014Garth laughed heartily at my embarrassment; said, I had not been long enough acquainted with Lord Hallifax, to know his way yet: that I need not puzzle myself in looking those places over and over when I got home. \"All you need do, (said he) is to leave them just as they are; call on Lord Hallifax two or three months hence, thank him for his kind observations on those passages; and then read them to him as altered. I have known him much longer than you have, and will be answerable for the event.\"\u2014I followed his advice; waited on Lord Hallifax some time after: said, I hoped he would find his objections to those passages removed[;] read them to him exactly as they were at first; and his lordship was extremely pleased with them, and cried out, \"Ay now, Mr. Pope, they are perfectly right! nothing can be better.\""]
