["* The ancient Greeks knew the laws that govern the propagation of light in a uniform medium and upon its reflection. However, the law governing the refraction of light as it passes from one transparent medium to another was unknown until the last century. Snell discovered it, Descartes tried to explain it and Fermat criticized his explanation. Since then, many great geometers have researched the problem, although no one has yet found a way of harmonizing the law of refraction with more fundamental laws that Nature must obey.", "* It is interesting to note that Newton was not impressed by Descartes great argument for Gods existence derived from the idea of a perfect Being, nor by other metaphysical arguments that we have mentioned; yet Newtons own arguments for Gods existence from the uniformity and suitability of different parts of the universe would not have seemed like proofs to Descartes."]
