[...] In his 28th year—he seems to have been rather a late developer—Plotinus felt an impulse to study philosophy and thus went to [[Alexandria]]. He attended the lectures of the most eminent professors in Alexandria at the time, which reduced him to a state of complete depression. In the end, a friend who understood what he wanted took him to hear the self-taught philosopher Ammonius Saccas. When he had heard Ammonius speak, Plotinus said, “This is the man I was looking for,” and stayed with him for 11 years. Ammonius is the most mysterious figure in ancient Western philosophy. He was, it seems, a lapsed Christian (yet even this is not quite certain), and the one or two extant remarks about his thought suggest a fairly commonplace sort of traditional Platonism. A philosopher who could attract such devotion from Plotinus and who may also have been the philosophical master of the great Christian theologian [[Origen]] must have had something more to offer his pupils, but what it was is not known. That Plotinus stayed with him for 11 years is in no way surprising. One did not enter an ancient philosophical school to take courses and obtain a degree but rather to join in what might well be a lifelong cooperative following of the way to truth, goodness, and the ultimate liberation of the spirit.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Scott|first=Walter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0YqAQAAMAAJ|title=Hermetica: Introduction, texts, and translation|date=1982|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-87773-338-6|pages=2|language=en}}</ref> He is mainly known as the teacher of [[Plotinus]], whom he taught from 232 to 242.<ref name=""Britannica""/> He was undoubtedly the biggest influence on Plotinus in his development of Neoplatonism, although little is known about his own philosophical views.

Children\'s increase in playing and pretending takes place in this stage. However, the child still has trouble seeing things from different points of view. The children\'s play is mainly categorized by symbolic play and manipulating symbols. Such play is demonstrated by the idea of checkers being snacks, pieces of paper being plates, and a box being a table. Their observations of symbols exemplifies the idea of play with the absence of the actual objects involved. By observing sequences of play, Piaget was able to demonstrate that, towards the end of the second year, a qualitatively new kind of psychological functioning occurs, known as the preoperational stage.<ref name=""Santrock, John W. 2004"">Santrock, John W.

Liang felt that the prevalent newspapers of the time were ""no more than a mass commodity"".  He criticized that those newspapers ""failed to have the slightest influence upon the nation as a society"".'), ('Philosophical Works', "": After escaping Beijing and the government crackdown on anti-Qing protesters, Liang studied the works of [[Western philosopher]]s of the [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period, namely [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[David Hume|Hume]] and [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]], translating them and introducing his own interpretation of their works.

The raw side consists of warp threads and woof threads, scarlet threads and green threads, but on the finished side are flowers, grass, and fabulous birds.

In that human consciousness comprehends the essence or [[noumena]] of an object and the object\'s external [[phenomenon]] which are then assembled into a complete organic whole called experience. Much of an object\'s defining and understanding in consciousness is not derived discursively but rather intuitively or instinctively as an object has no meaning outside of the whole of existence. Lossky summed up this concept in the term ""all is [[wiktionary:Imminent|imminent]] in all"". As such much of reality as uncreated or uncaused is irrational, or random (see libertarianism below) and can not be validated rationally (i.e. freedom and love as energy are uncaused, uncreated).

The cause is always the substantival agent himself as the bearer of creative power, and the other circumstances are merely \'\'occasions\'\' for its manifestations, which are neither forced nor predetermined by them.

In the Aufbau, concepts are taken to denote objects, relations, properties, classes and states. Carnap argues that all concepts must be ranked over a hierarchy. In that hierarchy, all concepts are organized according to a fundamental arrangement where concepts can be reduced and converted to other basic ones. Carnap explains that a concept can be reduced to another when all sentences containing the first concept can be transformed into sentences containing the other. In other words, every scientific sentence should be translatable into another sentence such that the original terms have the same reference as the translated terms. Most significantly, Carnap argues that the basis of this system is psychological. Its content is the ""immediately given"", which is made of basic elements, namely perceptual experiences. These basic elements consist of conscious psychological states of a single human subject.

It wants to be proclaimed by witnesses—that is, by persons who proclaim the teaching and also existentially express it. The modern notion of a pastor as it is now is a complete misunderstanding. Since pastors also presumably should express the essentially Christian, they have quite rightly discovered how to relax the requirement, abolish the ideal. What is to be done now? Yes, now we must prepare for another tactical advance. First a detachment of poets; almost sinking under the demands of the ideal, with the glow of a certain unhappy love they set forth the ideal. Present-day pastors may now take second rank. These religious poets must have the particular ability to do the kind of writing that helps people out into the current. When this has happened, when a generation has grown up that from childhood on has received the pathos-filled impression of an existential expression of the ideal, the monastery and the genuine witnesses of the truth will both come again. This is how far behind the cause of Christianity is in our time. The first and foremost task is to create pathos, with the superiority of intelligence, imagination, penetration, and wit to guarantee pathos for the existential, which \'the understanding\' has reduced to the ludicrous. | title = JP VI 6521 Pap.
