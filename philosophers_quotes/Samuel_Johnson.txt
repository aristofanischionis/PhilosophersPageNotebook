It is therefore of the utmost importance that those, who have any intention of deviating from the beaten roads of life, and acquiring a reputation superior to names hourly swept away by time among the refuse of fame, should add to their reason, and their spirit, the power of persisting in their purposes; acquire the art of sapping what they cannot batter, and the habit of vanquishing obstinate resistance by obstinate attacks.",

  "* Example is always more efficacious than precept.",
  "* Such is the common process of marriage. A youth and maiden meeting by chance, or brought together by artifice, exchange glances, reciprocate civilities, go home, and dream of one another. Having little to divert attention, or diversify thought, they find themselves uneasy when they are apart, and therefore conclude that they shall be happy together. They marry, and discover what nothing but voluntary blindness had before concealed; they wear out life in altercations, and charge nature with cruelty.",
  "* \"That the dead are seen no more,\" said Imlac, \"I will not undertake to maintain against the concurrent and unvaried testimony of all ages and of all nations. There is no people, rude or learned, among whom apparitions of the dead are not related and believed. This opinion, which perhaps prevails as far as human nature is diffused, could become universal only by its truth: those that never heard of one another would not have agreed in a tale which nothing but experience can make credible. That it is doubted by single cavillers can very little weaken the general evidence, and some who deny it with their tongues confess it by their fears. \"Yet I do not mean to add new terrors to those which have already seized upon Pekuah. There can be no reason why spectres should haunt the Pyramid more than other places, or why they should have power or will to hurt innocence and purity. Our entrance is no violation of their privileges: we can take nothing from them; how, then, can we offend them?\"",

  "* \"Some,\" answered Imlac, \"have indeed said that the soul is material, but I can scarcely believe that any man has thought it, who knew how to think; for all the conclusions of reason enforce the immateriality of mind, and all the notices of sense and investigations of science, concur to prove the unconsciousness of matter.",
  "* [Imlac continues] \"It was never supposed that cogitation is inherent in matter, or that every particle is a thinking being. Yet, if any part of matter be devoid of thought, what part can we suppose to think? Matter can differ from matter only in form, density, bulk, motion, and direction of motion: to which of these, however varied or combined, can consciousness be annexed? To be round or square, to be solid or fluid, to be great or little, to be moved slowly or swiftly one way or another, are modes of material existence, all equally alien from the nature of cogitation. If matter be once without thought, it can only be made to think by some new modification, but all the modifications which it can admit are equally unconnected with cogitative powers.\" ",
  "* It ought to be deeply impressed on the minds of all who have voices in this national deliberation, that no man can deserve a seat in parliament, who is not a patriot. No other man will protect our rights: no other man can merit our confidence. A patriot is he whose publick conduct is regulated by one single motive, the love of his country; who, as an agent in parliament, has, for himself, neither hope nor fear, neither kindness nor resentment, but refers every thing to the common interest.",
  "* Let us take a patriot, where we can meet him; and, that we may not flatter ourselves by false appearances, distinguish those marks which are certain, from those which may deceive; for a man may have the external appearance of a patriot, without the constituent qualities; as false coins have often lustre, though they want weight.",
  "* Some claim a place in the list of patriots, by an acrimonious and unremitting opposition to the court. This mark is by no means infallible. Patriotism is not necessarily included in rebellion. A man may hate his king, yet not love his country.",
  "* The greater, far the greater number of those who rave and rail, and inquire and accuse, neither suspect nor fear, nor care for the publick; but hope to force their way to riches, by virulence and invective, and are vehement and clamorous, only that they may be sooner hired to be silent.",
  "* A man sometimes starts up a patriot, only by disseminating discontent, and propagating reports of secret influence, of dangerous counsels, of violated rights, and encroaching usurpation. This practice is no certain note of patriotism. To instigate the populace with rage beyond the provocation, is to suspend publick happiness, if not to destroy it. He is no lover of his country, that unnecessarily disturbs its peace. Few errours and few faults of government, can justify an appeal to the rabble; who ought not to judge of what they cannot understand, and whose opinions are not propagated by reason, but caught by contagion. The fallaciousness of this note of patriotism is particularly apparent, when the clamour continues after the evil is past.",
  "* The change of religion in Scotland, eager and vehement as it was, raised an epidemical enthusiasm, compounded of sullen scrupulousness and warlike ferocity, which, in a people whom idleness resigned to their own thoughts, and who conversing only with each other, suffered no dilution of their zeal from the gradual influx of new opinions, was long transmitted in its full strength from the old to the young, but by trade and intercourse with England, is now visibly abating, and giving way too fast to their laxity of practice and indifference of opinion, in which men, not sufficiently instructed to find the middle point, too easily shelter themselves from rigour and constraint.",
  "* Power and wealth supply the place of each other. Power confers the ability of gratifying our desire without the consent of others. Wealth enables us to obtain the consent of others to our gratification. Power, simply considered, whatever it confers on one, must take from another. Wealth enables its owner to give to others, by taking only from himself. Power pleases the violent and proud: wealth delights the placid and the timorous. Youth therefore flies at power, and age grovels after riches.",
  "* Of the proportion, which the product of any region bears to the people, an estimate is commonly made according to the pecuniary price of the necessities of life; which is never certain, because it supposes what is far from truth, that the value of money is always the same, and so measures an unknown quantity by an uncertain standard. It is competent enough when the markets of the same country, at different times, and those times not too distant, are to be compared; but of very little use for the purpose of making one nation acquainted with the state of another.

  "* It is not by comparing line with line, that the merit of great works is to be estimated, but by their general effects and ultimate result. It is easy to note a weak line, and write one more vigorous in its place; to find a happiness of expression in the original, and transplant it by force into the version: but what is given to the parts may be subducted from the whole, and the reader may be weary, though the critick may commend. Works of imagination excel by their allurement and delight; by their power of attracting and detaining the attention. That book is good in vain, which the reader throws away. He only is the master, who keeps the mind in pleasing captivity; whose pages are perused with eagerness, and in hope of new pleasure are perused again; and whose conclusion is perceived with an eye of sorrow, such as the traveller casts upon departing day.",

It is, that every man may have his cause fairly tried, by men appointed to try causes. A lawyer is not to tell what he knows to be a lie: he is not to produce what he knows to be a false deed; but he is not to usurp the province of the jury and of the judge, and determine what shall be the effect of evidence \u2014 what shall be the result of legal argument.",

  "* Towering is the confidence of twenty-one.",
  "* No man will be a sailor who has contrivance enough to get himself into a jail; for being in a ship is being in a jail, with the chance of being drowned.",
  "* Small debts are like small shot; they are rattling on every side, and can scarcely be escaped without a wound; great debts are like cannon, of loud noise but little danger.",
  "* Hope is itself a species of happiness, and, perhaps, the chief happiness which this world affords: but, like all other pleasures immoderately enjoyed, the excesses of hope must be expiated by pain; and expectations improperly indulged must end in disappointment. If it be asked, what is the improper expectation which it is dangerous to indulge, experience will quickly answer, that it is such expectation as is dictated not by reason, but by desire; expectation raised, not by the common occurrences of life, but by the wants of the expectant; an expectation that requires the common course of things to be changed, and the general rules of action to be broken.",
  "* Nothing is little to him that feels it with great sensibility.",
  "* A man of genius has been seldom ruined but by himself.",
  "* Great abilities are not requisite for an Historian; for in historical composition, all the greatest powers of the human mind are quiescent. He has facts ready to his hand; so there is no exercise of invention. Imagination is not required in any high degree; only about as much as is used in the lower kinds of poetry.",
  "* Norway, too, has noble wild prospects; and Lapland is remarkable for prodigious noble wild prospects. But, Sir, let me tell you, the noblest prospect which a Scotchman ever sees, is the high road that leads him to England!",
  "* A man ought to read just as inclination leads him; for what he reads as a task will do him little good.",
  "* But if he does really think that there is no distinction between virtue and vice, why, Sir, when he leaves our houses let us count our spoons.",
  "* I remember very well, when I was at Oxford, an old gentleman said to me, \"Young man, ply your book diligently now, and acquire a stock of knowledge; for when years come upon you, you will find that poring upon books will be but an irksome task.\"",
  "* Hume, and other sceptical innovators, are vain men, and will gratify themselves at any expence. Truth will not afford sufficient food to their vanity; so they have betaken themselves to errour. Truth, Sir, is a cow which will yield such people no more milk, and so they are gone to milk the bull. If I could have allowed myself to gratify my vanity at the expence of truth, what fame might I have acquired.",
  "* Sherry is dull, naturally dull; but it must have taken him a great deal of pains to become what we now see him. Such an excess of stupidity, sir, is not in Nature.",
  "* Sir, a womans preaching is like a dogs walking on his hinder legs. It is not done well; but you are surprised to find it done at all.",
  "* I [Boswell] happened to say, it would be terrible if he should not find a speedy opportunity of returning to London, and be confined in so dull a place. JOHNSON: \"Dont, Sir, accustom yourself to use big words for little matters. It would not be terrible, though I were to be detained some time here.\"",
  "* I refute it thus.",
  "* Why, Sir, it is difficult to settle the proportion of iniquity between them.",
  "* So far is it from being true that men are naturally equal, that no two people can be half an hour together, but one shall acquire an evident superiority over the other.",
  "* Shakspeare never has six lines together without a fault. Perhaps you may find seven: but this does not refute my general assertion.",
  "* It matters not how a man dies, but how he lives. The act of dying is not of importance, it lasts so short a time.",
  "* That fellow seems to me to possess but one idea, and that is a wrong one.",
  "* Johnson observed, that \"he did not care to speak ill of any man behind his back, but he believed the gentleman was an attorney.\"",
  "* A gentleman who had been very unhappy in marriage, married immediately after his wife died: Johnson said, it was the triumph of hope over experience.",
  "* A decent provision for the poor is the true test of civilization.",
  "* A cow is a very good animal in the field; but we turn her out of a garden.",
  "* Read over your compositions, and wherever you meet with a passage which you think is particularly fine, strike it out.",
  "* Attack is the reaction; I never think I have hit hard unless it rebounds.",
  "* The greatest part of a writers time is spent in reading, in order to write: a man will turn over half a library to make one book.",
  "* Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.",
  "* Hell is paved with good intentions.",
  "* Knowledge is of two kinds. We know a subject ourselves, or we know where we can find information upon it.",
  "* There is now less flogging in our great schools than formerly, but then less is learned there; so that what the boys get at one end they lose at the other.",
  "* There is nothing which has yet been contrived by man, by which so much happiness is produced as by a good tavern or inn.",
  "* This is one of the disadvantages of wine, it makes a man mistake words for thoughts.",
  "* A man is very apt to complain of the ingratitude of those who have risen far above him. A man when he gets into a higher sphere, into other habits of life, cannot keep up all his former connections. Then, Sir, those who knew him formerly upon a level with themselves, may think that they ought still to be treated as on a level, which cannot be; and an acquaintance in a former situation may bring out things which it would be very disagreeable to have mentioned before higher company, though, perhaps, everybody knows of them.",
  "* No man but a blockhead ever wrote except for money.",
  "* While grief is fresh, every attempt to divert only irritates. You must wait till grief be digested, and then amusement will dissipate the remains of it.",
  "* Life is a progress from want to want, not from enjoyment to enjoyment.",
  "* Sir, you have but two topicks, yourself and me. I am sick of both.",
  "* Life admits not of delays; when pleasure can be had, it is fit to catch it. Every hour takes away part of the things that please us, and perhaps part of our disposition to be pleased.",
  "* I [Boswell] was somewhat disappointed in finding that the edition of The English Poets, for which he was to write Prefaces and Lives, was not an undertaking directed by him: but that he was to furnish a Preface and Life to any poet the booksellers pleased. I asked him if he would do this to any dunces works, if they should ask him. JOHNSON: \"Yes, Sir, and say he was a dunce.\"",
  "* Depend upon it, Sir, when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully.",
  "* When a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford.",
  "* Heres to the next insurrection of the negroes in the West Indies.",
  "* It must be agreed that in most ages many countries have had part of their inhabitants in a state of slavery; yet it may be doubted whether slavery can ever be supposed the natural condition of man. It is impossible not to conceive that men in their original state were equal; and very difficult to imagine how one would be subjected to another but by violent compulsion. An individual may, indeed, forfeit his liberty by a crime; but he cannot by that crime forfeit the liberty of his children.",
  "* It is more from carelessness about truth than from intentional lying, that there is so much falsehood in the world.",
  "* All argument is against it; but all belief is for it.",
  "* It is mans own fault, it is from want of use, if his mind grows torpid in old age.",
  "* Every man thinks meanly of himself for not having been a soldier, or not having been at sea.",
  "* Every state of society is as luxurious as it can be. Men always take the best they can get.",
  "* A country governed by a despot is an inverted cone.",
  "* I am willing to love all mankind, except an American.",
  "* Pleasure of itself is not a vice.",
  "* All theory is against the freedom of the will; all experience for it.",
  "* As the Spanish proverb says, \"He, who would bring home the wealth of the Indies, must carry the wealth of the Indies with him.\" So it is in travelling; a man must carry knowledge with him, if he would bring home knowledge.",
  "* It is better to live rich, than to die rich.",
  "* The insolence of wealth will creep out.",
  "* All censure of a mans self is oblique praise. It is in order to shew how much he can spare.",
  "* Wine makes a man more pleased with himself. I do not say that it makes him more pleasing to others.",
  "* Were it not for imagination, Sir, a man would be as happy in the arms of a chambermaid as of a Duchess.",
  "* I would rather be attacked than unnoticed. For the worst thing you can do to an author is to be silent as to his works.",
  "* Claret is the liquor for boys; port for men; but he who aspires to be a hero must drink brandy.",
  "* A man who exposes himself when he is intoxicated, has not the art of getting drunk.",
  "* Worth seeing? yes; but not worth going to see.",
  "* If you are idle, be not solitary; if you are solitary, be not idle.",
  "* A Frenchman must be always talking, whether he knows anything of the matter or not; an Englishman is content to say nothing, when he has nothing to say.",
  "* Greek, sir, is like lace; every man gets as much of it as he can.",
  "* No man was more foolish when he had not a pen in his hand, or more wise when he had.",

  "* Classical quotation is the parole of literary men all over the world.",
  "* My friend was of opinion that when a man of rank appeared in that character [as an author], he deserved to have his merit handsomely allowed.",
  "* A jest breaks no bones.",
  "* I have two very cogent reasons for not printing any list of subscribers; \u2014 one, that I have lost all the names, \u2014 the other, that I have spent all the money.",
  "* Always, Sir, set a high value on spontaneous kindness. He whose inclination prompts him to cultivate your friendship of his own accord, will love you more than one whom you have been at pains to attach to you.",
  "* To let friendship die away by negligence and silence, is certainly not wise. It is voluntarily to throw away one of the greatest comforts of this weary pilgrimage.",
  "* Resolve not to be poor: whatever you have, spend less. Poverty is a great enemy to human happiness; it certainly destroys liberty, and it makes some virtues impracticable, and others extremely difficult.",
  "* A man may be so much of every thing, that he is nothing of any thing.",
  "* There is a wicked inclination in most people to suppose an old man decayed in his intellects. If a young or middle-aged man, when leaving a company, does not remember where he laid his hat, it is nothing; but if the same inattention is discovered in an old man, people will shrug up their shoulders, and say, \"His memory is going.\"",
  "* A man might write such stuff for ever, if he would abandon his mind to it.",
  "* Sir, there is no settling the point of precedency between a louse and a flea.",
  "* I never have sought the world; the world was not to seek me.",
  "* It is strange that there should be so little reading in the world, and so much writing. People in general do not willingly read, if they can have any thing else to amuse them.",
  "* As I know more of mankind, I expect less of them, and am ready now to call a man a good man, upon easier terms than I was formerly.",
  "* It might as well be said, \"Who drives fat oxen should himself be fat.\"",
  "* It is as bad as bad can be: it is ill-fed, ill-killed, ill-kept, and ill-drest.",
  "* Milton, Madam, was a genius that could cut a Colossus from a rock; but could not carve heads upon cherry-stones.",
  "* Courage is a quality so necessary for maintaining virtue that it is always respected, even when it is associated with vice.",
  "* Sir, I have found you an argument; but I am not obliged to find you an understanding.",
  "* Sir, I look upon every day to be lost, in which I do not make a new acquaintance.",

  "* God bless you, my dear!",
  "* Philips, whose touch harmonious could removeThe pangs of guilty power and hapless love!Rest here, distressd by poverty no more;Here find that calm thou gavst so oft before;Sleep undisturbd within this peaceful shrine,Till angels wake thee with a note like thine!",
  "* A Poet, Naturalist, and Historian,Who left scarcely any style of writing untouched,And touched nothing that he did not adorn.",
  "* How small of all that human hearts endure,That part which laws or kings can cause or cure!Still to ourselves in every place consigned,Our own felicity we make or find.With secret course, which no loud storms annoy,Glides the smooth current of domestic joy.",
  "* Trades proud empire hastes to swift decay.",
  "* Words are mens daughters, but Gods sons are things.",
  "* To be of no church is dangerous. Religion, of which the rewards are distant, and which is animated only by faith and hope, will glide by degrees out of the mind unless it be invigorated and reimpressed by external ordinances, by stated calls to worship, and the salutary influence of example.",
  "* The trappings of a monarchy would set up an ordinary commonwealth.",
  "* He is no wise man that will quit a certainty for an uncertainty.",
  "* A fellow that makes no figure in company, and has a mind as narrow as the neck of a vinegar-cruet.",
  "* The atrocious crime of being a young man, which the honourable gentleman has with such spirit and decency charged upon me, I shall neither attempt to palliate nor deny; but content myself with wishing that I may be one of those whose follies may cease with their youth, and not of that number who are ignorant in spite of experience.",
  "* Gloomy calm of idle vacancy.",
  "* Wretched un-idead girls.",
  "* Sir, he [Bolingbroke] was a scoundrel and a coward: a scoundrel for charging a blunderbuss against religion and morality; a coward, because he had not resolution to fire it off himself, but left half a crown to a beggarly Scotchman to draw the trigger at his death.",
  "* I am glad that he thanks God for anything.",
  "* Sir, I think all Christians, whether Papists or Protestants, agree in the essential articles, and that their differences are trivial, and rather political than religious.",
  "* Sir, your levellers wish to level down as far as themselves; but they cannot bear levelling up to themselves.",
  "* I look upon it, that he who does not mind his belly will hardly mind anything else.",
  "* This was a good dinner enough, to be sure, but it was not a dinner to ask a man to.",
  "** 1764",
  "* I do not know, sir, that the fellow is an infidel; but if he be an infidel, he is an infidel as a dog is an infidel; that is to say, he has never thought upon the subject.",
  "* I am a great friend to public amusements; for they keep people from vice.",

  "* The true, strong, and sound mind is the mind that can embrace equally great things and small.",
  "* I remember a passage in Goldsmiths \"Vicar of Wakefield,\" which he was afterwards fool enough to expunge: \"I do not love a man who is zealous for nothing.\"... There was another fine passage too which he struck out: \"When I was a young man, being anxious to distinguish myself, I was perpetually starting new propositions. But I soon gave this over; for I found that generally what was new was false.\"",
