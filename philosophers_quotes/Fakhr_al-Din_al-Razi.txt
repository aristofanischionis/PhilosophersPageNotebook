  "*It is established by evidence that there exists beyond the world a void without a terminal limit (khala la nihayata laha), and it is established as well by evidence that God Most High has power over all contingent beings (al-mumkinat\u2009). Therefore He the Most High has the power (qadir\u2009) to create a thousand thousand worlds (alfa alfi awalim) beyond this world such that each one of those worlds be bigger and more massive than this world as well as having the like of what this world has of the throne (al-arsh), the chair (al-kursiyy), the heavens (al-samawat\u2009) and the earth (al-ard\u2009), and the sun (al-shams) and the moon (al-qamar\u2009). The arguments of the philosophers (dalail al-falasifah) for establishing that the world is one are weak, flimsy arguments founded upon feeble premises. "
