  "* The first question we should face is: What is the aim of a physical theory? To this question diverse answers have been made, but all of them may be reduced to two main principles:\"A physical theory,\" certain logicians have replied, \"has for its object the explanation of a group of laws experimentally established.\"\"A physical theory,\" other thinkers have said, \"is an abstract system whose aim is to summarize and classify logically a group of experimental laws without claiming to explain these laws...Now these two questions \u2014 Does there exist a material reality distinct from sensible appearances? and What is the nature of reality? \u2014 do not have their source in experimental method, which is acquainted only with sensible appearances and can discover nothing beyond them. The resolution of these questions transcends the methods used by physics; it is the object of metaphysics.Therefore, if the aim of physical theories is to explain experimental laws, theoretical physics is not an autonomous science; it is subordinate to metaphysics...Now, to make physical theories depend on metaphysics is surely not the way to let them enjoy the privilege of universal consent.",
  "** Now, a symbol is not, properly speaking, either true or false; it is, rather, something more or less well selected to stand for the reality it represents, and pictures that reality in a more or less precise, or a more or less detailed manner.",
  "* A physical theory reputed to be satisfactory by the sectarians of one metaphysical school will be rejected by the partisans of another school.",
  "* Agreement with experiment is the sole criteria of truth for a physical theory.",
  "* The one who contributed most to break down the barrier between physical method and metaphysical method, and to confound their domains, so clearly distinguished in the Aristotelian philosophy, was surely Descartes.",
  "* Every time people cite a principle of theoretical physics in support of a metaphysical doctrine or physical dogma, they commit a mistake, for they attribute to this principle a meaning not its own, an import not belonging to it.",
  "* There you have, then, a theoretical physics which is neither the theory of a believer nor that of a nonbeliever, but merely and simply a theory of a physicist; admirably suited to classify the laws studied by the experimenter, it is incapable of opposing any assertion whatever of metaphysics or of religious dogma, and is equally incapable of lending effective support to any such assertion."
