  "* Gramscis remarks are rich and stimulating, but in the last analysis they follow the classical Marxist pattern of analysing religion. Engels, he distinguished two socially opposed currents: on one side the theocratic religion of the official churches, opium of the people, a mystifying apparatus at the service of the powerful; on the other the underground, subversive and heretical religion of the Albigensians, the Hussites, Joachim di Fiori, Thomas M\u00fcnzer, Franz von Baader, Wilhelm Weitling and Leo Tolstoy.",
  "* Marxism: the relentless materialist analysis of ideologies, idols and idolatries. The second, however, requires the warm stream of Marxism, seeking to rescue religions utopian cultural surplus, its critical and anticipatory force.",
  "* The most surprising and original part of &#91;Lucien Goldmanns&#93; work is, however, the attempt to comparewithout assimilating one to anotherreligious faith and Marxist faith: both have in common the refusal of pure individualism (rationalist or empiricist) and the belief in trans-individual valuesGod for religion, the human community for socialism. In both cases the faith is based on a wagerthe Pascalian wager on the existence of God and the Marxist wager on the liberation of humanitythat presupposes risk, the danger of failure and the hope of success.",
  "* For centuries, Catholic theology and popular tradition saw the poor as the earthly image of Christs sufferings. As the theologian A. Bonnefous wrote in his book Le Chrestian charitable (1637), the poor man one helps is perhaps Jesus Christ himself."
