  "** Time is the most valuable thing a man can spend.",
  "* The Unseasonable man is one who will go up to a busy person, and open his heart to him.  He will serenade his mistress when she has a fever. He will address himself to a man who has been cast in a surety-suit, and request him to become his security.  He will come to give evidence when the trial is over.",
  "* Superstition would seem to be simply cowardice in regard to the supernatural.",
  "** If you are an ignorant man, you are acting wisely; but if you have had any education, you are behaving like a fool.",
  "** Remember that life holds out many pleasing deceits to us by the vanity of glory; for that when we are beginning to live, then we are dying.  There is, therefore, nothing more profitless than ambition."
