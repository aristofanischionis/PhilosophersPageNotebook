  "* When time itself shall be no more,  And all things in confusion hurld,  Music shall then exert its power,  And sound survive the ruins of the world:  Then saints and angels shall agree  In one eternal jubilee:  All Heaven shall echo with their hymns divine,  And God himself with pleasure see  The whole creation in a chorus join.",
  "* Consecrate the place and day  To music and Cecilia.  Let no rough winds approach, nor dare  Invade the hallowd bounds,  Nor rudely shake the tuneful air,  Nor spoil the fleeting sounds.  Nor mournful sigh nor groan be heard,  But gladness dwell on every tongue;  Whilst all, with voice and strings prepard,  Keep up the loud harmonious song,  And imitate the blest above,  In joy, and harmony, and love.",

From theme to theme with secret pleasure tost,  Amidst the soft variety I m lost:  Here pleasing airs my ravishd soul confound  With circling notes and labyrinths of sound;  Here domes and temples rise in distant views,  And opening palaces invite my Muse.",

  "* Where have my ravishd senses been!  What joys, what wonders, have I seen!  The scene yet stands before my eye,  A thousand glorious deeds that lie  In deep futurity obscure,  Fights and triumphs immature,  Heroes immersd in times dark womb,  Ripening for mighty years to come,  Break forth, and, to the day displayd,  My soft inglorious hours upbraid.  Transported with so bright a scheme,  My waking life appears a dream.",

Mysterious love, uncertain treasure,Hast thou more of pain or pleasure!Chilld with tears,Killd with fears,Endless torments dwell about thee:Yet who would live, and live without thee!",
  "* The man resolved, and steady to his trust,  Inflexible to ill, and obstinately just,  May the rude rabbles insolence despise,  Their senseless clamours and tumultuous cries;  The tyrants fierceness he beguiles,  And the stern brow, and the harsh voice defies,  And with superior greatness smiles.",

  "* A mans first care should be to avoid the reproaches of his own heart; his next to escape the censures of the world: if the last interferes with the former, it ought to be entirely neglected; but otherwise there cannot be a greater satisfaction to an honest mind, than to see those approbations which it gives itself seconded by the applauses of the public: a man is more sure of his conduct, when the verdict which he passes upon his own behaviour is thus warranted and confirmed by the opinion of all that know him.",

Polished in courts, and hardened in the field,  Renowned for conquest, and in council skilled,  Their courage dwells not in a troubled flood  Of mounting spirits, and fermenting blood:  Lodged in the soul, with virtue overruled,  Inflamed by reason, and by reason cooled,  In hours of peace content to be unknown.

  "* \"Censure,\" says a late ingenious author, \"is the tax a man plays for being eminent.\" It is a folly for an eminent man to think of escaping it, and a weakness to be affected with it. All the illustrious persons of antiquity, and indeed of every age in the world, have passed through this fiery persecution. There is no defense against reproach but obscurity; it is a kind of comitant to greatness, as satires and invectives were an essential part of a Roman triumph.",
  "* If men of eminence are exposed to censure on one hand, they are as much liable to flattery on the other. If they receive reproaches which are not due to them, they likewise receive praises which they do not deserve. In a word, the man in a high post is never regarded with an indifferent eye, but always considered as a friend or an enemy. For this reason persons in great stations have seldom their true characters drawn till several years after their deaths. Their personal friendships and enmities must cease, and the parties they were engaged in be at an end, before their faults or their virtues can have justice done them. When writers have the least opportunity of knowing the truth, they are in the best disposition to tell it.  It is therefore the privilege of posterity to adjust the characters of illustrious persons, and to set matters right between those antagonists who by their rivalry for greatness divided a whole age into factions.",

  "* I Have often thought if the minds of men were laid open, we should see but little difference between that of the wise man and that of the fool. There are infinite reveries, numberless extravagances, and a perpetual train of vanities which pass through both. The great difference is, that the first knows how to pick and cull his thoughts for conversation, by suppressing some, and communicating others; whereas the other lets them all indifferently fly out in words.",
  "* There are many more shining qualities in the mind of man, but there is none so useful as discretion; it is this, indeed, which gives a value to all the rest, which sets them at work in their proper times and places, and turns them to the advantage of the person who is possessed of them. Without it, learning is pedantry, and wit impertinence; virtue itself looks like weakness; the best parts only qualify a man to be more sprightly in errors, and active to his own prejudice.",
  "* The discreet man finds out the talents of those he converses with, and knows how to apply them to proper uses. Accordingly, if we look into particular communities and divisions of men, we may observe that it is the discreet man, not the witty, nor the learned, nor the brave, who guides the conversation, and gives measures to the society.",
  "* Though a man has all other perfections, and wants discretion, he will be of no great consequence in the world; but if he has this single talent in perfection, and but a common share of others, he may do what he pleases in his station of life.",
  "* At the same time that I think discretion the most useful talent a man can be master of, I look upon cunning to be the accomplishment of little, mean, ungenerous minds. Discretion points out the noblest ends to us, and pursues the most proper and laudable methods of attaining them: cunning has only private selfish aims, and sticks at nothing which may make them succeed. Discretion has large and extended views, and, like a well-formed eye, commands a whole horizon: cunning is a kind of short-sightedness, that discovers the minutest objects which are near at hand, but is not able to discern things at a distance. Discretion the more it is discovered, gives a greater authority to the person who possesses it: cunning, when it is once detected, loses its force, and makes a man incapable of bringing about even those events which he might have done had he passed only for a plain man. Discretion is the perfection of reason, and a guide to us in all the duties of life: cunning is a kind of instinct, that only looks out after our immediate interest and welfare. Discretion is only found in men of strong sense and good understandings, cunning is often to be met with in brutes themselves, and in persons who are but the fewest removes from them.",
  "* Cunning is only the mimic of discretion, and may pass upon weak men in the same manner as vivacity is often mistaken for wit, and gravity for wisdom.",
  "* The cast of mind which is natural to a discreet man, make him look forward into futurity, and consider what will be his condition millions of ages hence, as well as what it is at present. He knows that the misery or happiness which are reserved for him in another world, lose nothing of their reality by being placed at so great a distance from him. The objects do not appear little to him because they are remote. He considers that those pleasures and pains which lie hid in eternity, approach nearer to him every moment, and will be present with him in their full weight and measure, as much as those pains and pleasures which he feels at this very instant. For this reason he is careful to secure to himself that which is the proper happiness of his nature, and the ultimate design of his being. He carries his thoughts to the end of every action, and considers the most distant as well as the most immediate effects of it. He supersedes every little prospect of gain and advantage which offers itself here, if he does not find it consistent with his views of an hereafter. In a word, his hopes are full of immortality, his schemes are large and glorious, and his conduct suitable to one who knows his true interest, and how to pursue it by proper methods.",

Evil may at some future period bring forth good; and good may bring forth evil, both equally unexpected.",

Without it, what is man? A splendid slave, a reasoning savage.",
  "* They were a people so primitive they did not know how to get money, except by working for it.",
  "* Plenty of people wish to become devout, but no one wishes to be humble.",
  "* The beloved of the Almighty are: the rich who have the humility of the poor, and the poor who have the magnanimity of the rich.",
