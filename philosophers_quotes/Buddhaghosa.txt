  "* Only virtues water canwash out the stain in living things.",
  "* Shine as they may, there are no kingsAdorned with jewelry and pearlsThat shine as does a man restrainedAdorned with virtues ornament.",
  "* He whose mind is satisfiedwith virtue that has been achieved,Who never thinks to stir himselfAnd take a meditation subject up,Contented with mere virtuousness,Nor striving for a higher stateHis virtue bears the appellationOf that partaking of stagnation.",
  "* Hate seeks out only unreal faults, while understanding seeks out only real faults."
