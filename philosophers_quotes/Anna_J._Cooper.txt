  "* Respect for woman, the much lauded chivalry of the Middle Ages, meant what I fear it still means to some men in our own day\u2014respect for the elect few among whom they expect to consort.",
  "*The idea of the radical amelioration of womankind, reverence for woman as woman regardless of rank, wealth, or culture, was to come from that rich and bounteous fountain from which flow all our liberal and universal ideas\u2014the Gospel of Jesus Christ.",
  "* We too often mistake individuals\u2019 honor for race development and so are ready to substitute pretty accomplishments for sound sense and earnest purpose.",
  "* \"I am my Sisters keeper!\" should be the hearty response of every man and woman of the race, and this conviction should purify and exalt the narrow, selfish and petty personal aims of life into a noble and sacred purpose.",
  "* When colored persons have been employed it was too often as machines or as manikins. There has been no disposition, generally, to get the black mans ideal or to let his individuality work by its own gravity.",
  "* Since the idea of order and subordination succumbed to barbarian brawn and brutality in the fifth century, the civilized world has been like a child brought up by his father. It has needed the great mother heart to teach it to be pitiful, to love mercy, to succor the weak and care for the lowly.",
  "* Whence this sneaking admiration we all have for bullies and prize-fighters? Whence the self-congratulation of \u201cdominant\u201d races, as if \u201cdominant\u201d meant \u201crighteous\u201d and carried with it a title to inherit the earth? Whence the scorn of so-called weak or unwarlike races and individuals, and the very comfortable assurance that it is their manifest destiny to be wiped out as vermin before this advancing civilization? As if the possession of the Christian graces of meekness, non-resistance and forgiveness, were incompatible with a civilization professedly based on Christianity, the religion of love!",
  "* Our God is power; strength, our standard of excellence, inherited from barbarian ancestors through a long line of male progenitors, the Law Salic permitting no feminine modifications. ",
  "* You will not find science annihilating personality from the government of the Universe and making of God an ungovernable, unintelligible, blind, often destructive physical force; you will not find jurisprudence formulating as an axiom the absurdity that man and wife are one, and that one the man\u2014that the married woman may not hold or bequeath her own property save as subject to her husbands direction; you will not find political economists declaring that the only possible adjustment between laborers and capitalists is that of selfishness and rapacity\u2014that each must get all he can and keep all that he gets, while the world cries laissez faire and the lawyers explain, \"it is the beautiful working of the law of supply and demand;\" in fine, you will not find the law of love shut out from the affairs of men after the feminine half of the world\u2019s truth is completed.",
  "* A boy, however meager his equipment and shallow his pretentions, had only to declare a floating intention to study theology and he could get all the support, encouragement and stimulus he needed, be absolved from work and invested beforehand with all the dignity of his far away office. While a self-supporting girl had to struggle on by teaching in the summer and working after school hours to keep up with her board bills, and actually to fight her way against positive discouragements to the higher education; till one such girl one day flared out and told the principal \u201cthe only mission opening before a girl in his school was to marry one of those candidates.\u201d",
  "* The earnest well trained Christian young woman, as a teacher, as a home-maker, as wife, mother, or silent influence even, is as potent a missionary agency among our people as is the theologian; and I claim that at the present stage of our development in the South she is even more important and necessary. ",
  "*  One needs occasionally to stand aside from the hum and rush of human interests and passions to hear the voices of God. And it not unfrequently happens that the All-loving gives a great push to certain souls to thrust them out, as it were, from the distracting current for awhile to promote their discipline and growth, or to enrich them by communion and reflection. And similarly it may be womans privilege from her peculiar coigne of vantage as a quiet observer, to whisper just the needed suggestion or the almost forgotten truth. The colored woman, then, should not be ignored because her bark is resting in the silent waters of the sheltered cove. She is watching the movements of the contestants none the less and is all the better qualified, perhaps, to weigh and judge and advise because not herself in the excitement of the race.",
  "* To me, faith means treating the truth as true.",
  "*Jesus believed in the infinite possibilities of an individual soul. His faith was a triumphant realization of the eternal development of the best in man\u2014an optimistic vision of the human aptitude for endless expansion and perfectibility. This truth to him placed a sublime valuation on each individual sentiency\u2013a value magnified infinitely by reason of its immortal destiny."
