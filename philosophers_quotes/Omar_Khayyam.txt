  "* By the help of God and with His precious assistance, I say that Algebra is a scientific art. The objects with which it deals are absolute numbers and measurable quantities which, though themselves unknown, are related to \"things\" which are known, whereby the determination of the unknown quantities is possible. Such a thing is either a quantity or a unique relation, which is only determined by careful examination. What one searches for in the algebraic art are the relations which lead from the known to the unknown, to discover which is the object of Algebra as stated above. The perfection of this art consists in knowledge of the scientific method by which one determines numerical and geometric unknowns.",
  "* I was unable to devote myself to the learning of this algebra and the continued concentration upon it, because of obstacles in the vagaries of time which hindered me; for we have been deprived of all the people of knowledge save for a group, small in number, with many troubles, whose concern in life is to snatch the opportunity, when time is asleep, to devote themselves meanwhile to the investigation and perfection of a science; for the majority of people who imitate philosophers confuse the true with the false, and they do nothing but deceive and pretend knowledge, and they do not use what they know of the sciences except for base and material purposes; and if they see a certain person seeking for the right and preferring the truth, doing his best to refute the false and untrue and leaving aside hypocrisy and deceit, they make a fool of him and mock him.",
  "* Whoever thinks algebra is a trick in obtaining unknowns has thought it in vain. No attention should be paid to the fact that algebra and Elements.",
  "* Wake! For the Heavn, and strikes  The Sultans Turret with a Shaft of Light.",
  "* Before the phantom of False morning died,  Methought a Voice within the Tavern cried,  \"When all the Temple is prepared within,  Why nods the drowsy Worshipper outside?\"",
  "* And, as the Cock crew, those who stood before  The Tavern shouted \u2014 \"Open then the Door!  You know how little while we have to stay,  And, once departed, may return no more\".",
  "* Now the New Year reviving old Desires,  The thoughtful Soul to Solitude retires,  Where the White Hand Of Moses on the Bough  Puts out, and Jesus from the Ground suspires.",
  "* Iram indeed is gone with all his Rose,  And Jamshyds Sevn-ringd Cup where no one knows;  But still a Ruby kindles in the Vine,  And many a Garden by the Water blows.",
  "* Come, fill the Cup, and in the fire of Spring  Your Winter-garment of Repentance fling:  The Bird of Time has but a little way  To flutter \u2014 and the Bird is on the Wing.",
  "* Whether at Naishapur or Babylon,  Whether the Cup with sweet or bitter run,  The Wine of Life keeps oozing drop by drop,  The Leaves of Life keep falling one by one.",
  "* Each Morn a thousand Roses brings, you say;  Yes, but where leaves the Rose of Yesterday?",
  "* A Book of Verses underneath the Bough,  A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread \u2014 and Thou  Beside me singing in the Wilderness \u2014  Oh, Wilderness were Paradise enow!",
  "* Some for the Glories of This World; and some  Sigh for the Prophets Paradise to come;  Ah, take the Cash, and let the Credit go,  Nor heed the rumble of a distant Drum!",
  "* The Worldly Hope men set their Hearts upon  Turns Ashes \u2014 or it prospers; and anon,  Like Snow upon the Deserts dusty Face,  Lighting a little hour or two \u2014 is gone.",
  "* I sometimes think that never blows so red  The Rose as where some buried Caesar bled;  That every Hyacinth the Garden wears  Dropt in her Lap from some once lovely Head.",
  "* And this reviving Herb whose tender Green  Fledges the River-Lip on which we lean \u2014  Ah, lean upon it lightly! for who knows  From what once lovely Lip it springs unseen!",
  "* Ah, my Beloved fill the Cup that clears  To-day Past Regrets and Future Fears:  To-morrow! \u2014 Why, To-morrow I may be  Myself with Yesterdays Sevn Thousand Years.",
  "* For some we loved, the loveliest and the best  That from his Vintage rolling Time hath prest,  Have drunk their Cup a Round or two before,  And one by one crept silently to rest.",
  "* Ah, make the most of what we yet may spend,  Before we too into the Dust descend;  Dust into Dust, and under Dust to lie  Sans Wine, sans Song, sans Singer, and \u2014 sans End!",
  "* Alike for those who for To-day prepare,  And those that after some To-morrow stare,  A Muezzin from the Tower of Darkness cries  \"Fools! your Reward is neither Here nor There\".",
  "* Why, all the Saints and Sages who discussd  Of the Two Worlds so wisely \u2014 they are thrust  Like foolish Prophets forth; their Words to Scorn  Are scatterd, and their Mouths are stopt with Dust.",
  "* Myself when young did eagerly frequent  Doctor and Saint, and heard great argument  About it and about: but evermore  Came out by the same door where in I went.",
  "* With them the seed of Wisdom did I sow,  And with mine own hand wrought to make it grow;  And this was all the Harvest that I reapd \u2014  \"I came like Water, and like Wind I go\".",
  "* Into this Universe, and Why not knowing  Nor Whence, like Water willy-nilly flowing;  And out of it, as Wind along the Waste,  I know not Whither, willy-nilly blowing.",
  "* What, without asking, hither hurried Whence?  And, without asking, Whither hurried hence!  Oh, many a Cup of this forbidden Wine  Must drown the memory of that insolence!",
  "* Up from Earths Centre through the Seventh Gate  rose, and on the Throne of Saturn sate;  And many a Knot unraveld by the Road;  But not the Master-knot of Human Fate.",
  "* There was the Door to which I found no Key;  There was the Veil through which I might not see:  Some little talk awhile of Me and Thee  There was \u2014 and then no more of Thee and Me.",
  "* Then of the Thee in Me works behind  The Veil, I lifted up my hands to find  A Lamp amid the Darkness; and I heard,  As from Without \u2014 \"The Me Within Thee Blind!\"",
  "* Then to the lip of this poor earthen Urn  I leand, the Secret of my Life to learn:  And Lip to Lip it murmurd \u2014 \"While you live  Drink! \u2014 for, once dead, you never shall return\".",

  "* Tis but a Tent where takes his one days rest  A Sultan to the realm of Death addrest;  The Sultan rises, and the dark Ferrash  Strikes, and prepares it for another Guest.",
  "* And fear not lest Existence closing your  Account, and mine, should know the like no more;  The Eternal Saki from that Bowl has pourd  Millions of Bubbles like us, and will pour.",

  "* Would you that spangle of Existence spend  About the Secret \u2014 Quick about it, Friend!  A Hair perhaps divides the False and True \u2014  And upon what, prithee, may life depend?",
  "* A Hair perhaps divides the False and True;  Yes; and a single Alif were the clue \u2014  Could you but find it \u2014 to the Treasure-house,  And peradventure to The Master too;",
  "* Whose secret Presence, through Creations veins  Running Quicksilver-like eludes your pains;  Taking all shapes from Mah to Mahi; and  They change and perish all \u2014 but He remains;",
  "* A moment guessd \u2014 then back behind the Fold  Immerst of Darkness round the Drama rolld  Which, for the Pastime of Eternity,  He doth Himself contrive, enact, behold.",
  "* But if in vain, down on the stubborn floor  Of Earth, and up to Heavns unopening Door  You gaze To-day, while You are You \u2014 how then  To-morrow, You when shall be You no more?",
  "* Waste not your Hour, nor in the vain pursuit  Of This and That endeavour and dispute;  Better be jocund with the fruitful Grape  Than sadden after none, or bitter, Fruit.",
  "* You know, my Friends, with what a brave Carouse  I made a Second Marriage in my house;  Divorced old barren Reason from my Bed  And took the Daughter of the Vine to Spouse.",

  "* And lately, by the Tavern Door agape,  Came shining through the Dusk an Angel Shape  Bearing a Vessel on his Shoulder; and  He bid me taste of it; and twas \u2014 the Grape!",
  "* The Grape that can with Logic absolute  The Two-and-Seventy jarring Sects confute:  The sovereign Alchemist that in a trice  Lifes leaden metal into Gold transmute: ",
  "* The mighty Mahmud, Allah-breathing Lord  That all the misbelieving and black Horde  Of Fears and Sorrows that infest the Soul  Scatters before him with his whirlwind Sword.",
  "* Why, be this Juice the growth of God, who dare  Blaspheme the twisted tendril as a Snare?  A Blessing, we should use it, should we not?  And if a Curse \u2014 why, then, Who set it there?",
  "* I must abjure the Balm of Life, I must,  Scared by some After-reckoning taen on trust,  Or lured with Hope of some Diviner Drink,  To fill the Cup \u2014 when crumbled into Dust!",
  "* Oh, threats of Hell and Hopes of Paradise!  One thing at least is certain \u2014 This Life flies;  One thing is certain and the rest is Lies;  The Flower that once has blown for ever dies. ",

  "* The Revelations of Devout and Learnd  Who rose before us, and as Prophets burnd,  Are all but Stories, which, awoke from Sleep,  They told their comrades, and to Sleep returnd.",
  "* I sent my Soul through the Invisible,  Some letter of that After-life to spell:  And by and by my Soul returnd to me,  And answerd \"I Myself am Heavn and Hell:\" ",
  "* Heavn but the Vision of fulfilld Desire,  And Hell the Shadow from a Soul on fire,  Cast on the Darkness into which Ourselves,  So late emerged from, shall so soon expire.",
  "* We are no other than a moving row  Of Magic Shadow-shapes that come and go   Round with the Sun-illumined Lantern held  In Midnight by the Master of the Show;",

  "* The Ball no question makes of Ayes and Noes,  But Here or There as strikes the Player goes;  And He that tossd you down into the Field,  He knows about it all \u2014 He knows \u2014 HE knows!",

  "* Said one among them \u2014 \"Surely not in vain  My substance of the common Earth was taen  And to this Figure moulded, to be broke,  Or trampled back to shapeless Earth again\".",
  "* Then said a Second \u2014 \"Neer a peevish Boy  Would break the Bowl from which he drank in joy,  And He that with his hand the Vessel made  Will surely not in after Wrath destroy\".",
  "* After a momentary silence spake  Some Vessel of a more ungainly Make;  \"They sneer at me for leaning all awry:  What! did the Hand then of the Potter shake?\"",
  "* Whereat some one of the loquacious Lot \u2014  I think a Sufi pipkin-waxing hot \u2014  \"All this of Pot and Potter \u2014 Tell me then,  Who is the Potter, pray, and who the Pot?\"",
  "* \"Why,\" said another, \"Some there are who tell  Of one who threatens he will toss to Hell  The luckless Pots he marrd in making \u2014 Pish!  Hes a Good Fellow, and twill all be well\".",

  "* That evn my buried Ashes such a snare  Of Vintage shall fling up into the Air  As not a True-believer passing by  But shall be overtaken unaware.",
  "* Indeed the Idols I have loved so long  Have done my credit in this World much wrong:  Have drownd my Glory in a shallow Cup  And sold my Reputation for a Song.",
  "* Indeed, indeed, Repentance oft before  I swore \u2014 but was I sober when I swore?  And then and then came Spring, and Rose-in-hand  My thread-bare Penitence apieces tore.",
  "* And much as Wine has playd the Infidel,  And robbd me of my Robe of Honour \u2014 Well,  I wonder often what the Vintners buy  One half so precious as the stuff they sell.",
  "* Yet Ah, that Spring should vanish with the Rose!  That Youths sweet-scented manuscript should close!  The Nightingale that in the branches sang,  Ah, whence, and whither flown again, who knows!",
  "* Would but some winged Angel ere too late  Arrest the yet unfolded Roll of Fate,  And make the stern Recorder otherwise  Enregister, or quite obliterate!",
  "* Ah, Love! could you and I with Him conspire  To grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,  Would not we shatter it to bits \u2014 and then  Re-mould it nearer to the Hearts Desire!",
  "* Yon rising Moon that looks for us again \u2014  How oft hereafter will she wax and wane;  How oft hereafter rising look for us  Through this same Garden \u2014 and for one in vain!",
  "* And when like her, oh, Saki, you shall pass  Among the Guests Star-scatterd on the Grass,  And in your joyous errand reach the spot  Where I made One \u2014 turn down an empty Glass!",
  "*Allah, perchance, the secret word might spell;  If Allah be, He keeps His secret well;  What He hath hidden, who shall hope to find?  Shall God His secret to a maggot tell?  \u2026  The Koran! well, come put me to the test\u2014  Lovely old book in hideous error drest\u2014  Believe me, I can quote the Koran too,  The unbeliever knows his Koran best.   And do you think that unto such as you,  A maggot-minded, starved, fanatic crew,  God gave the secret, and denied it me?\u2014  Well, well, what matters it! believe that too."
