  "* Kuhn as does Popper rejects the idea that science grows by accumulation of eternal truths.. But while according to Popper science is \u2018revolution in permanence\u2019, and criticism the heart of the scienti\ufb01c enterprise, according to Kuhn revolution is exceptional and, indeed, extra-scienti\ufb01c, and criticism is, in \u2018normal\u2019 times, anathema... The clash between Popper and Kuhn is not about a mere technical point in epistemology. It concerns our central intellectual values, and has implications not only for theoretical physics but also for the underdeveloped social sciences and even for moral and political philosophy. If even in science there is no other way of judging a theory but by assessing the number, faith and vocal energy of its supporters, then this must be even more so in the social sciences: truth lies in power. Thus Kuhn\u2019s position would vindicate, no doubt, unintentionally, the basic political credo of contemporary religious maniacs (\u2018student revolutionaries\u2019).",
  "* Where theory lags behind the facts, we are dealing with miserable degenerating research programmes.",
  "* For the sophisticated falsificationist a scientific theory T is falsified if and only if another theory T has been proposed with the following characteristics :",
  "*Blind commitment to a theory is not an intellectual virtue: it is an intellectual crime.",
  "* For centuries knowledge meant proven knowledge... Einsteins results again turned the tables and now very few philosophers or scientists still think that scientific knowledge is, or can be, proven knowledge. But few realize that with this the whole classical structure of intellectual values falls in ruins and has to be replaced.",
  "* Our empirical criterion for a series of theories is that it should produce new facts. The idea of growth and the concept of empirical character are soldered into one.",
  "* It would be wrong to assume that one must stay with a research programme until it has exhausted all its heuristic power, that one must not introduce a rival programme before everybody agrees that the point of degeneration has probably been reached."
