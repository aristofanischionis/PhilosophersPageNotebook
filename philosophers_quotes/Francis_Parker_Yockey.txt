  "* Between Capitalism and Socialism there is no relationship of true and false. Both are instincts, and have the same historical rank, but one of them belongs to the Past, and one to the Future. Capitalism is a product of Rationalism and Materialism, and was the ruling force of the 19th century.  Socialism is the form of an age of political Imperialism, of Authority, of historical philosophy, of superpersonal political imperative. ",
  "*The explanation Marxism offered of the significance of History was ludicrously simple, and in this very simplicity lay its charm, and its strength. The whole history of the world was merely the record of the struggle of classes. Religion, philosophy, science, technics, music, painting, poetry, nobility, priesthood, Emperor and Pope State, war, and politics \u2014 all are simply reflections of economics. Not economics generally, but the \"struggle\" of \"classes.\" The most amazing thing about this ideological picture is that it was ever put forward seriously, or taken seriously.",
  "* We have been born into a certain Culture, at a certain phase of its organic development, we have certain gifts.  These condition the earthly task which we must perform.  The metaphysical task is beyond any conditioning, for it would have been the same in any age anywhere.  The earthly task is merely the form of the higher task, its organic vehicle.",
  "* The question of who strikes first in a war is on the same level as who strikes first in a boxing contest."
