  "* The White Knight must not have whiskers; he must not be made to look old.",
  "* \"You have no mind to be unkind,\"  Said echo in her ear:  \"No mind to bring a living thing  To suffering or fear.  For all thats bad, or mean or sad, you have no mind,  my dear.\"",
  "* The `Why? cannot, and need not, be put into words. Those for whom a childs mind is a sealed book, and who see no divinity in a childs smile, would read such words in vain: while for any one that has ever loved one true child, no words are needed. For he will have known the awe that falls on one in the presence of a spirit fresh from GODs hands, on whom no shadow of sin, and but the outermost fringe of the shadow of sorrow, has yet fallen: he will have felt the bitter contrast between the haunting selfishness that spoils his best deeds and the life that is but an overflowing love--for I think a childs first attitude to the world is a simple love for all living things: and he will have learned that the best work a man can do is when he works for loves sake only, with no thought of name, or gain, or earthly reward. No deed of ours, I suppose, on this side the grave, is really unselfish: yet if one can put forth all ones powers in a task where nothing of reward is hoped for but a little childs whispered thanks, and the airy touch of a little childs pure lips, one seems to come somewhere near to this.",
  "* To Her, whose childrens smiles fed the narrators fancy and were his rich reward: from the Author.",
  "* I charm in vain; for never again,  All keenly as my glance I bend,  Will Memory, goddess coy,  Embody for my joy  Departed days, nor let me gaze  On thee, my fairy friend!",
  "* If you want to inspire confidence, give plenty of statistics \u2013 it does not matter that they should be accurate, or even intelligible, so long as there is enough of them.",
  "* \"And at last weve got to the end of this ideal racecourse! Now that you accept A and B and C and D, of course you accept Z.\"  \"Do I?\" said the Tortoise innocently. \"Lets make that quite clear. I accept A and B and C and D. Suppose I still refused to accept Z?\"  \"Then Logic would take you by the throat, and force you to do it!\" Achilles triumphantly replied. \"Logic would tell you, You cant help yourself. Now that youve accepted A and B and C and D, you must accept Z! So youve no choice, you see.\"  \"Whatever Logic is good enough to tell me is worth writing down,\" said the Tortoise. \"So enter it in your notebook, please. We will call it  (E) If A and B and C and D are true, Z must be true.  Until Ive granted that, of course I neednt grant Z. So its quite a necessary step, you see?\"  \"I see,\" said Achilles; and there was a touch of sadness in his tone.",
  "* But surely you trust God! Do you think He would let you come to harm? To be afraid is to distrust.",
  "* As you have invited me, I cannot come, for I have made a rule to decline all invitations; but I will come the next day.",
  "* \"What may I do?\" at length I cried,  Tired of the painful task.  The fairy quietly replied,  And said \"You must not ask.\"",
  "* There was once a young man of Oporta,  Who daily got shorter and shorter,  The reason he said  Was the hod on his head  Which was filled with the heaviest mortar.",
  "* The day was wet, the rain fell souse  Like jars of strawberry jam, a  sound was heard in the old henhouse,  A beating of a hammer.",
  "* And so it fell upon a day,  (That is, it never rose again)",
  "* Fair stands the ancient Rectory,  The Rectory of Croft,  The sun shines bright upon it,  The breezes whisper soft.  From all the house and garden  Its inhabitants come forth,  And muster in the road without,  And pace in twos and threes about,  The children of the North.",
  "* The rabbits bow before thee,  And cower in the straw;  The chickens are submissive,  And own thy will for law;  Bullfinches and canary  Thy bidding do obey;  And een the tortoise in its shell  Doth never say thee nay.",
  "* One winter night, at half past nine,  Cold, tired, and cross, and muddy,  I had come home, too late to dine",
  "* \"Ive caught a cold,\" the Thing replies,  \"Out there upon the landing.\"  I turned to look in some surprise,  And there, before my very eyes,  A little Ghost was standing!",
  "* And as to being in a fright,  Allow me to remark  That Ghosts have just as good a right  In every way, to fear the light,  As Men to fear the dark.",
  "* Yet still to choose a brat like you,  To haunt a man of forty-two,  Was no great compliment!\"",
  "* Port-wine, he says, when rich and sound,  Warms his old bones like nectar:  And as the inns, where it is found,  Are his especial hunting-ground,  We call him the INN-SPECTRE.",
  "* \"That narrow window, I expect,  Serves but to let the dusk in - \"  \"But please,\" said I, \"to recollect  Twas fashioned by an architect  Who pinned his faith on Ruskin!\"",
  "* Now thats a thing I WILL NOT STAND,  And so I tell you flat.",
  "* Oh, when I was a little Ghost,  A merry time had we!  Each seated on his favourite post,  We chumped and chawed the buttered toast  They gave us for our tea.",
  "* My father was a Brownie, Sir;  My mother was a Fairy.  The notion had occurred to her,  The children would be happier,  If they were taught to vary.   The notion soon became a craze;  And, when it once began, she  Brought us all out in different ways -  One was a Pixy, two were Fays,  Another was a Banshee.",
  "* Whos the Knight-Mayor?\" I cried. Instead  Of answering my question,  \"Well, if you dont know THAT,\" he said,  \"Either you never go to bed,  Or youve a grand digestion!",
  "* He is immensely fat, and so  Well suits the occupation:  In point of fact, if you must know,  We used to call him years ago,  THE MAYOR AND CORPORATION!",
  "* So, to reward him for his run  (As it was baking hot,  And he was over twenty stone),  The King proceeded, half in fun,  To knight him on the spot.",
  "* Lady Clara Vere de Vere  Was eight years old, she said:  Every ringlet, lightly shaken, ran itself in golden thread.",
  "* There are certain things - as, a spider, a ghost,  The income-tax, gout, an umbrella for three -  That I hate, but the thing that I hate the most  Is a thing they call the Sea.",
  "* There is an insect that people avoid  (Whence is derived the verb to flee).  Where have you been by it most annoyed?  In lodgings by the Sea.",
  "*From his shoulder Hiawatha  Took the camera of rosewood,  Made of sliding, folding rosewood;  Neatly put it all together.  In its case it lay compactly,  Folded into nearly nothing;But he opened out the hinges,  Pushed and pulled the joints and hinges,  Till it looked all squares and oblongs,  Like a complicated figure  In the Second Book of Euclid.",
  "*Finally my Hiawatha  Tumbled all the tribe together,  (Grouped is not the right expression),  And, as happy chance would have it  Did at last obtain a picture  Where the faces all succeeded:  Each came out a perfect likeness.Then they joined and all abused it,  Unrestrainedly abused it,  As the worst and ugliest picture  They could possibly have dreamed of.  Giving one such strange expressions -  Sullen, stupid, pert expressions.  Really any one would take us  (Any one that did not know us)  For the most unpleasant people!  (Hiawatha seemed to think so,  Seemed to think it not unlikely.)",
  "* I NEVER loved a dear Gazelle \u2013  Nor anything that cost me much:  High prices profit those who sell,  but why should I be fond of such?",
  "* Then proudly smiled that old man  To see the eager lad  Rush madly for his pen and ink  And for his blotting-pad \u2013  But, when he thought of publishing,  His face grew stern and sad.",
  "*O gin I find anither ladye,  He said wi sighs and tears,  I wot my coortin sall not be  Anither thirty years:For gin I find a ladye gay,  Exactly to my taste,  Ill pop the question, aye or nay,  In twenty years at maist.",
  "** Four Riddles, no. I",
  "*A change came oer my Vision - it was night:  We clove a pathway through a frantic throng:  The steeds, wild-plunging, filled us with affright:  The chariots whirled along.Within a marble hall a river ran -  A living tide, half muslin and half cloth:  And here one mourned a broken wreath or fan,  Yet swallowed down her wrath",
  "* A sadder vision yet: thine aged sire  Shaming his hoary locks with treacherous wile!  And dost thou now doubt Truth to be a liar?  And wilt thou die, that hast forgot to smile?",
  "* The air is bright with hues of light  And rich with laughter and with singing:  Young hearts beat high in ecstasy,  And banners wave, and bells are ringing:  But silence falls with fading day,  And theres an end to mirth and play.  Ah, well-a-day!",
  "*Blow, blow your trumpets till they crack,  Ye little men of little souls!  And bid them huddle at your back -  Gold-sucking leeches, shoals on shoals!Fill all the air with hungry wails -  \"Reward us, ere we think or write!  Without your Gold mere Knowledge fails  To sate the swinish appetite!\"",
  "*Is all our Life, then, but a dream  Seen faintly in the golden gleam  Athwart Times dark resistless stream?Bowed to the earth with bitter woe  Or laughing at some raree-show  We flutter idly to and fro.Mans little Day in haste we spend,  And, from its merry noontide, send  No glance to meet the silent end.",
  "* I do not know if Alice in Wonderland was an original story \u2014 I was, at least, no conscious imitator in writing it \u2014 but I do know that, since it came out, something like a dozen story-books have appeared, on identically the same pattern. The path I timidly explored believing myself to be the first that ever burst into that silent sea \u2014 is now a beaten high-road: all the way-side flowers have long ago been trampled into the dust: and it would be courting disaster for me to attempt that style again.",
  "* I believe this thought, of the possibility of death \u2014 if calmly realised, and steadily faced would be one of the best possible tests as to our going to any scene of amusement being right or wrong. If the thought of sudden death acquires, for you, a special horror when imagined as happening in a theatre, then be very sure the theatre is harmful for you, however harmless it may be for others; and that you are incurring a deadly peril in going. Be sure the safest rule is that we should not dare to live in any scene in which we dare not die.  But, once realise what the true object is in life \u2014 that it is not pleasure, not knowledge, not even fame itself, that last infirmity of noble minds \u2014 but that it is the development of character, the rising to a higher, nobler, purer standard, the building-up of the perfect Man \u2014 and then, so long as we feel that this is going on, and will (we trust) go on for evermore, death has for us no terror; it is not a shadow, but a light; not an end, but a beginning!",
  "* Less Bread! More Taxes!--and then all the people cheered again, and one man, who was more excited than the rest, flung his hat high into the air, and shouted (as well as I could make out) \"Who roar for the Sub-Warden?\" Everybody roared, but whether it was for the Sub-Warden, or not, did not clearly appear: some were shouting \"Bread!\" and some \"Taxes!\", but no one seemed to know what it was they really wanted.",
  "* I suppose every child has a world of his own \u2014 and every man, too, for the matter of that. I wonder if thats the cause for all the misunderstanding there is in Life?",
  "* He thought he saw an Elephant,  That practised on a fife:  He looked again, and found it was  A letter from his wife.  At length I realise, he said,  The bitterness of Life!",
  "* He thought he saw a Bankers Clerk  Descending from the bus:  He looked again, and found it was  A Hippopotamus:  If this should stay to dine, he said,  There wont be much for us!",
  "* The West is the fitting tomb for all the sorrow and the sighing, all the errors and the follies of the Past: for all its withered Hopes and all its buried Loves! From the East comes new strength, new ambition, new Hope, new Life, new Love! Look Eastward! Aye, look Eastward!\"",
  "* Fading, with the Night, the memory of a dead love, and the withered leaves of a blighted hope, and the sickly repinings and moody regrets that numb the best energies of the soul: and rising, broadening, rolling upward like a living flood, the manly resolve, and the dauntless will, and the heavenward gaze of faith \u2014 the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen!  \"Look Eastward! Aye, look Eastward!\"",
  "*Some American writer has said \u201cthe snakes in this district may be divided into one species\u2014the venomous\u201d. The same principle applies here. Postage-Stamp-Cases may be divided into one species, the \u201cWonderland\u201d. Imitations of it will soon appear, no doubt: but they cannot include the two Pictorial Surprises, which are copyright.You dont see why I call them Surprises? Well, take the Case in your left hand, and regard it attentively. You see Alice nursing the Duchesss Baby ? (An entirely new combination, by the way : it doesnt occur in the book.) Now, with your right thumb and forefinger, lay hold of the little book, and suddenly pull it out. The Baby has turned into a Pig I If that doesnt surprise you, why, I suppose you wouldnt be surprised if your own Mother-in-law suddenly turned into a Gyroscope!",
  "* Since I have possessed a \"Wonderland Stamp Case\", Life has been bright and peaceful, and I have used no other. I believe the Queens laundress uses no other.",
  "* If the Letter is to be in answer to another, begin by getting out that other letter and reading it through, in order to refresh your memory, as to what it is you have to answer, and as to your correspondent\u2019s present address (otherwise you will be sending your letter to his regular address in London, though he has been careful in writing to give you his Torquay address in full).",
  "* Put the date in full. It is another aggravating thing, when you wish, years afterwards, to arrange a series of letters, to find them dated \"Feb. 17\", \"Aug. 2\", without any year to guide you as to which comes first. And never, never, dear Madam (N.B. this remark is addressed to ladies only: no man would ever do such a thing), put \"Wednesday\", simply, as the date!",
  "* Here is a golden Rule to begin with. Write legibly. The average temper of the human race would be perceptibly sweetened, if everybody obeyed this Rule! A great deal of the bad writing in the world comes simply from writing too quickly.",
  "* If doubtful whether to end with \u201cyours faithfully\u201d, or \u201cyours truly\u201d, or \u201cyour most truly\u201d, &c. (there are at least a dozen varieties, before you reach \u201cyours affectionately\u201d), refer to your correspondent\u2019s last letter, and make your winding-up at least as friendly as his: in fact, even if a shade more friendly, it will do no harm!",
  "* God has given to Man an absolute right to take the lives of other animals, for any reasonable cause, such as the supply of food; but He has not given to Man the right to inflict pain, unless where necessary.",
  "* I wasnt asleep! said Bruno, in a deeply-injured tone. \"When I shuts mine eyes, its to show that Im awake!\"",
  "* Say, what is the spell, when her fledgelings are cheeping,  That lures the bird home to her nest?  Or wakes the tired mother, whose infant is weeping,  To cuddle and croon it to rest?",
  "* Say, whence is the voice that, when anger is burning,  Bids the whirl of the tempest to cease?  That stirs the vexed soul with an aching \u2014 a yearning  For the brotherly hand-grip of peace?",
  "* Tis a secret: none knows how it comes, how it goes:  But the name of the secret is Love!",
  "* All in the waning light she stood,  The star of perfect womanhood.",
  "* The dying crimson of the West  That faintly tinged his haggard cheek,  Fell on her as she stood, and shed  A glory round the patient head.",
  "* Not as in rest she bowed,  But large hot tears were coursing down her cheek.  And her low-panted sobs broke awefully  Upon the sleeping echoes of the night.",
  "* And she arose, and in that darkening room  Stood lonely as a spirit of the night \u2014  Stood calm and fearless in the gathered night \u2014  And raised her eyes to heaven. There were tears  Upon her face, but in her heart was peace.  Peace that the world nor gives nor takes away!",
  "* O bitter is it to abide  In weariness alway:  At dawn to sigh for eventide,  At eventide for day.  Thy noon hath fled: thy sun hath shone:  The brightness of thy day is gone:  What need to lag and linger on  Till life be cold and gray?",
  "*Ye golden hours of Lifes young spring,  Of innocence, of love and truth!  Bright, beyond all imagining,  Thou fairy-dream of youth!Id give all wealth that years have piled,  The slow result of Lifes decay,  To be once more a little child  For one bright summer-day.",
  "*In her eyes is the living Hght  Of a wanderer to earth  From a far celestial height:  Summers five are all the span \u2014  Summers five since Time began  To veil in mists of human night  A shining angel-birth.Does an angel look from her eyes?  Will she suddenly spring away,  And soar to her home in the skies?  Beatrice! Blessing and blessed to be!",
  "* The light was faint, and soft the air  That breathed around the place;  And she was lithe, and tall, and fair,  And with a wayward grace  Her queenly head she bare.",
  "* An island-farm \u2014 broad seas of corn  Stirred by the wandering breath of morn \u2014  The happy spot where I was born.",
  "*Those locks of jet are turned to gray,  And she is strange and far away  That might have been mine own to-day \u2014That might have been mine own, my dear,  Through many and many a happy year \u2014  That might have sat beside me here.",
  "* The pictures, with their ruddy light,  Are changed to dust and ashes white,  And I am left alone with night.",
  "* Last night we owned, with looks forlorn,  \"Too well the scholar knows  There is no rose without a thorn\" \u2014  But peace is made! We sing, this morn,  \"No thorn without a rose!\"  Our Latin lesson is complete:  Weve learned that Love is Bitter-Sweet!",
  "* All too soon will Childhood gay  Realise Lifes sober sadness.  Lets be merry while we may,  Innocent and happy Fay!  Elves were made for gladness!",
  "* Went to the new Church both morning and afternoon, and read service in the afternoon. I got through it all with great success, till I came to read out the first verse of the hymn before the sermon, where the two words \u2018strife strengthened,\u2019 coming together, were too much for me, and I had to leave the verse unfinished.",
  "* I mark this day with a white stone.",
  "* The proper definition of a man is an animal that writes letters.",
  "* One of the deep secrets of life is that all that is really worth the doing is what we do for others.",
