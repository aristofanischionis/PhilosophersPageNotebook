  "*I call God to witness that all I have written and preached, has been to rescue souls from sin.  There can be no turning back.  My Lord walked the path of truth and duty, even though it took Him to Calvary.  Can I, one of his humble followers, turn back now?  To witness to Gods truth is more important than life.  Joyfully then, will I confirm with my blood all the writings and preachings of truths that Ive held.  Into Thy hands, O Lord, I commit my spirit.*",
  "* God is my witness that I have never taught or preached that which false witnesses have testified against me. He knows that the great object of all my preaching and writing was to convert men from sin. In the truth of that gospel which hitherto I have written, taught and preached, I now joyfully die.",
  "** It is better to die well, than to live wrongly (...) who is afraid of death loses the joy of life; truth prevails all, prevails who is killed, because no adversity can harm him, who is not dominated by injustice.",
  "** O holy simplicity!",
  "* The people from Prague and other Czechs should be whipped who speak half Czech and half German (...) And who could enumerate how the Czech language has already been corrupted, so that the true Czech hears they speak, but he does not understand them. And from that arises envy, anger, conflict, strife and Czech humiliation.",
  "* It is impossible that Christendom finds its peace in Gods will, if the priesthood is not being called to order.",
  "* Even a most evil man is better than the devil!",
  "* If I knew a foreigner from anywhere in his virtue who would love God and would be interested in the good more than my own brother, he would be dearer to me than my brother. And hence I prefer good English priests over timid Czech priests and good German over an evil brother.",
  "* The only law that a Christian should listen to and read is the law of Gods Commandments. And it is not right to comply with, implement or observe any other law."
