  "* Wisdom denotes the pursuing of the best Ends by the best Means.",
  "* Whence this secret Chain between each Person and Mankind? How is my Interest connected with the most distant Parts of it?",
  "* That Action is best, which procures the greatest Happiness for the greatest Numbers; and that worst, which, in like manner, occasions Misery.",
  "* Another valuable purpose of ridicule is with relation to smaller vices, which are often more effectually corrected by ridicule, than by grave admonition. Men have been laughed out of faults which a sermon could not reform; nay, there are many little indecencies which are improper to be mentioned in such solemn discourses. Now ridicule with contempt or ill-nature, is indeed always irritating and offensive; but we may, by testifying a just esteem for the good qualities of the person ridiculed, and our concern for his interests, let him see that our ridicule of his weakness flows from love to him, and then we may hope for a good effect. This then is another necessary rule, \"That along with our ridicule of smaller faults we should always join evidences of good nature and esteem.\"  As to jests upon imperfections, which one cannot amend, I cannot fee of what use they can be: men of sense cannot relish such jests; foolish trifling minds may by them be led to despise the truest merit, which is not exempted from the casual misfortunes of our mortal state.",
  "* All our Ideas, or the materials of our reasoning or judging, are received by some immediate Powers of Perception internal or external, which we may call Senses \u2026 Reasoning or Intellect seems to raise no new Species of Ideas, but to discover or discern the Relations of those received.",
  "* Whoever voluntarily undertakes the necessary office of rearing and educating, obtains the parental power without generation.",
  "* The ultimate notion of right is that which tends to the universal good; and when ones acting in a certain manner has this tendency, he has a right thus to act."
