  "* How vast a memory has Love!",
  "* Nothing can be more shocking and horrid than one of our kitchens sprinkled with blood, and abounding with the cries of expiring victims, or with the limbs of dead animals scattered or hung up here and there. It gives one the image of a giants den in a romance, bestrewed with scattered heads and mangled limbs.",
  "* I find myself just in the same situation of mind you describe as your own, heartily wishing the good, that is the quiet of my country, and hoping a total end of all the unhappy divisions of mankind by party-spirit, which at best is but the madness of many for the gain of a few.",

  "* I am growing fit, I hope, for a better world, of which light of the sun is but a shadow: for I doubt not but Gods works here, are what comes nearest to his works there; and that a true relish of the beauties of nature is the most easy preparation and gentlest transition to an enjoyment of those of heaven; as on the contrary a true town life of hurry, confusion, noise, slander, and dissension, is a fort of apprenticeship to hell and its furies... The separation of my soul and body is what I could think of with less pain; for I sm very sure he that made it will take care of it, and in whatever state he pleases it shall be, that state must be right; but I cannot think without tears of beingseparated from my friends, when their condition is so douubtful, that they may want even such assistance as mine",
  "* I think it was a generous thought, and one that fowd from an exalted mind, that it was not improbable but God might be delighted with the various methods of worshipping him, which divided the whole world.",

  "* Who neer knew joy but friendship might divide,  Or gave his father grief but when he died.",
  "* Methinks God has punishd the Avaritious as he often punishes sinners, in their own way, in the ver sin itself: the thrist of gain was their crime, that thrist continued became their punishment and ruin. As for the few who have the good fortune to remain with half of what they imagined they had (among whom is your humble servantl, I would have them sensible of their felicity, and convinced of the truth of old Hesiods maxim, who, after half his estate was swallowed by the Directors of those days, resolvd, that half to be more than the whole.",

  "* The famous Lord Hallifax (though so much talked of) was rather a pretender to taste, than really possessed of it.\u2014When I had finished the two or three first books of my translation of the Iliad, that lord, \"desired to have the pleasure of hearing them read at his house.\" Addison, Congreve, and Garth, were there at the reading.\u2014In four or five places, Lord Hallifax stopped me very civilly; and with a speech, each time of much the same kind: \"I beg your pardon, Mr. Pope, but there is something in that passage that does not quite please me.\u2014Be so good as to mark the place, and consider it a little at your leisure.\u2014I am sure you can give it a little turn.\"\u2014I returned from Lord Hallifaxs with Dr. Garth, in his chariot; and as we were going along, was saying to the doctor, that my lord had laid me under a good deal of difficulty, by such loose and general observations; that I had been thinking over the passages almost ever since, and could not guess at what it was that offended his lordship in either of them.\u2014Garth laughed heartily at my embarrassment; said, I had not been long enough acquainted with Lord Hallifax, to know his way yet: that I need not puzzle myself in looking those places over and over when I got home. \"All you need do, (said he) is to leave them just as they are; call on Lord Hallifax two or three months hence, thank him for his kind observations on those passages; and then read them to him as altered. I have known him much longer than you have, and will be answerable for the event.\"\u2014I followed his advice; waited on Lord Hallifax some time after: said, I hoped he would find his objections to those passages removed[;] read them to him exactly as they were at first; and his lordship was extremely pleased with them, and cried out, \"Ay now, Mr. Pope, they are perfectly right! nothing can be better.\"",
  "* For he lives twice who can at once employ  The present well, and een the past enjoy.",
  "* I have nothing to say for rhyme, but that I doubt whether a poem can support itself without it, in our language; unless it be stiffened with such strange words, as are likely to destroy our language itself.",
  "* What terrible moments does one feel after one has engaged for a large work! In the beginning of my translating the Iliad, I wished any body would hang me a hundred times. It sat so heavily on my mind at first, that I often used to dream of it; and do so sometimes still. When I fell into the method of translating 30 or 40 verses before I got up, and piddled with it the rest of the morning, it went on easily enough; and when I was thoroughly got into the way of it, I did the rest with pleasure.",
  "* There, take (says Justice), take ye each a shell:  We thrive at Westminster on fools like you;  T was a fat oyster,\u2014live in peace,\u2014adieu.",
  "* Let such, such only tread this sacred floor,  Who dare to love their country and be poor.",
  "* The Iliad took me up six years, and during that time, and particularly the first part of it, I was often under great pain and apprehensions. Though I conquered the thoughts of it in the day, they would frighten me in the night. I dreamed often of being engaged in a long journey, and that I should never get to the end of it. This made so strong an impression upon me, that I sometimes dream of it still; of being engaged in that translation, of having got about half way through it, and being embarrassed, and under dread of never completing it.",

  "* I think a good deal may be said to extenuate the fault of bad Poets. What we call a Genius, is hard to be distinguishd by a man himself, from a strong inclination: and if his genius be ever so great, he can not at first discover it any other way, than by giving way to that prevalent propensity which renders him the more liable to be mistaken.",
  "* Therefore they who say our thoughts are not our own because they resemble the Ancients, may as well say our faces are not our own, because they are like our Fathers: And indeed it is very unreasonable, that people should expect us to be Scholars, and yet be angry to find us so.",
  "* I would not be like those Authors, who forgive themselves some particular lines for the sake of a whole Poem, and vice versa a whole Poem for the sake of some particular lines. I believe no one qualification is so likely to make a good writer, as the power of rejecting his own thoughts.",

  "* The sick in body call for aid: the sick  In mind are covetous of more disease;  And when at worst, they dream themselves quite well.  To know ourselves diseased, is half our cure.",
