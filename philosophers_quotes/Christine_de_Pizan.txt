  "** For what would I be otherwise but sport,In love with one who does not care for me?I will hide pain in smiles, sooner than beThe common talk.  It is a bitter art To sing a happy song with a sad heart.",
  "** Alone am I, and alone I wish to be;Alone my sweet love has left me.Alone am I, without friend or mate,Alone am I, mournful and angry.",
  "** The man or the woman in whom resides greater virtue is the higher; neither the loftiness nor the lowliness of a person lies in the body according to the sex, but in the perfection of conduct and virtues.",
  "** If it were customary to send daughters to school like sons, and if they were then taught the natural sciences, they would learn as thoroughly and understand the subtleties of all the arts and sciences as well as sons.",
  "** How many women are there\u2026who because of their husbands harshness spend their weary lives in the bond of marriage in greater suffering than if they were slaves among the Saracens?"
