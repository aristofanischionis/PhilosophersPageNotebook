  "* When I arrived at Harvard in 1969, my fellow first-year graduate students and I were taken up to the roof of the Widener Library by a well-known professor of classics. He told us how many Episcopal churches could be seen from that vantage point. As a Jew (in fact a convert from Episcopalian Christianity), I knew that my husband and I would have been forbidden to marry in Harvards church, which had just refused to accept a Jewish wedding. As a woman I could not eat in the main dining room of the faculty club, even as a members guest. Only a few years before, a woman would not have been able to use the undergraduate library. In 1972 I became the first female to hold the Junior Fellowship that relieved certain graduate students from teaching so that they could get on with their research. At that time I received a letter of congratulation from a prestigious classicist saying that it would be difficult to know what to call a female fellow, since \"fellowess\" was an awkward term. Perhaps the Greek language could solve the problem: since the masculine for \"fellow\" in Greek was hetairos, I could be called a hetaira. Hetaira, however, as I knew, is the ancient Greek word not for \u201cfellowess\u201d but for \u201ccourtesan.\u201d"
