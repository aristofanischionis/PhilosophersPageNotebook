  "* I was Euphorbus at the siege of Troy.",
  "* By the air which I breathe, and by the water which I drink, I will not endure to be blamed on account of this discourse.",
  "*Dear youths, I warn you cherish peace divine,  And in your hearts lay deep these words of mine.",
  "**The soul of man is divided into three parts, intelligence, reason, and passion. Intelligence and passion are possessed by other animals, but reason by man alone.",
  "** We ought so to behave to one another as to avoid making enemies of our friends, and at the same time to make friends of our enemies.",
  "** In anger we should refrain both from speech and action.",

  "* Anger begins in folly, and ends in repentance.",
  "* Choose always the way that seems the best, however rough it may be; custom will soon render it easy and agreeable.",

  "* Truth is so great a perfection, that if God would render himself visible to men, he would choose light for his body and truth for his soul.",
  "* There are men and gods, and beings like Pythagoras.",
  "* There is no word or action but has its echo in Eternity.  Thought is an Idea in transit, which when once released, never can be lured back, nor the spoken word recalled.

  "* There is geometry in the humming of the strings, there is music in the spacing of the spheres.",

What have I left undone, which I ought to have done? Begin thus from the first act, and proceed; and, in conclusion, at the ill which thou hast done, be troubled, and rejoice for the good.",
  "* Meditate upon my counsels; love them; follow them;  To the divine virtues will they know how to lead thee.  I swear it by the One who in our hearts engraved  The sacred Tetrad, symbol immense and pure,  Source of Nature and model of the Gods.",
  "* Holding fast to these things, you will know the worlds of gods and mortals which permeates and governs everything. And you will know, as is right, nature similar in all respects, so that you will neither entertain unreasonable hopes nor be neglectful of anything.",
  "* You will know that wretched men are the cause of their own suffering, who neither see nor hear the good that is near them, and few are the ones who know how to secure release from their troubles. Such is the fate that harms their minds; like pebbles they are tossed about from one thing to another with cares unceasing.

  "* Choose rather to be strong in soul than in body.",
  "* It is difficult to walk at one and the same time many paths of life.",

Wealth is an infirm anchor, glory is still more infirm; and in a similar manner, the body, dominion, and honour. For all these are imbecile and powerless. What then are powerful anchors. Prudence, magnanimity, fortitude. These no tempest can shake. This is the Law of God, that virtue is the only thing that is strong; and that every thing else is a trifle.",

  "* Those alone are dear to Divinity who are hostile to injustice.",
  "* None can be free who is a slave to, and ruled by, his passions.",

  "* Not frequently man from man.",
  "* When a reasonable Soul forsaketh his divine nature, and becometh beast-like, it dieth. For though the substance of the Soul be incorruptible: yet, lacking the use of Reason, it is reputed dead; for it loseth the Intellective Life. ",
  "* A good Soul hath neither too great joy, nor too great sorrow: for it rejoiceth in goodness; and it sorroweth in wickedness.

  "* Honor Wisdom; and deny it not to them that would learn; and shew it unto them that dispraise it! Sow not the sea fields! ",
  "* Wisdom thoroughly learned, will never be forgotten.  Science is got by diligence; but Discretion and Wisdom cometh of GOD. ",
  "* Without Justice, no realm may prosper.",
  "* Happy is that City that hath a wise man to govern it.",
  "* To use Virtue is perfect blessedness. ",

  "* Virtue is harmony.",
