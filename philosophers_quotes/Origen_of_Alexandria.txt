  "* Having refuted, then, as well as we could, every notion which might suggest that we were to think of God as in any degree corporeal, we go on to say that, according to strict truth, God is incomprehensible, and incapable of being measured. For whatever be the knowledge which we are able to obtain of God, either by perception or reflection, we must of necessity believe that He is by many degrees far better than what we perceive Him to be.",
  "* That is properly termed everlasting or eternal which neither had a beginning of John when he says that God is splendour of that light, not only in respect of its being light, but also of being everlasting light, so that His wisdom is eternal and everlasting splendour. If this be fully understood, it clearly shows that the existence of the Son is derived from the Father but not in time, nor from any other beginning, except, as we have said, from God Himself.",
  "* In this way, then, by the renewal of the ceaseless working of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in us, in its various stages of progress, shall we be able at some future time perhaps, although with difficulty, to behold the holy and the blessed life, in which (as it is only after many struggles that we are able to reach it) we ought so to continue, that no satiety of that blessedness should ever seize us; but the more we perceive its blessedness, the more should be increased and intensified within us the longing for the same, while we ever more eagerly and freely receive and hold fast the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. But if satiety should ever take hold of any one of those who stand on the highest and perfect summit of attainment, I do not think that such an one would suddenly be deposed from his position and fall away, but that he must decline gradually and little by little, so that it may sometimes happen that if a brief lapsus take place, and the individual quickly repent and return to himself, he may not utterly fall away, but may retrace his steps, and return to his former place, and again make good that which had been lost by his negligence.",
  "* Every being which is endowed with reason, and transgresses its statutes and limitations, is undoubtedly involved in sin by swerving from rectitude and justice.",
  "*An end or consummation would seem to be an indication of the perfection and completion of things. ... These subjects, indeed, are treated by us with great solicitude and Psalm 110:1) And if the meaning of the prophet\u2019s language here be less clear, we may ascertain it from the Apostle Paul, who speaks more openly, thus: \u201cFor Christ must reign until He has put all enemies under His feet.\u201d (1 Cor 15:25) But if even that unreserved declaration of the apostle do not sufficiently inform us what is meant by \u201cenemies being placed under His feet,\u201d listen to what he says in the following words, \u201cFor all things must be put under Him.\u201d (1 Cor 15:27) What, then, is this \u201cputting under\u201d by which all things must be made subject to Christ?  I am of opinion that it is this very subjection by which we also wish to be subject to Him, by which the apostles also were subject, and all the saints who have been followers of Christ. For the name \u201csubjection,\u201d by which we are subject to Christ, indicates that the salvation which proceeds from Him belongs to His subjects, agreeably to the declaration of David, \u201cShall not my soul be subject unto God? From Him cometh my salvation.\u201d (Psalm 62:1)",
  "* As the eye naturally seeks the light and vision, and our body naturally desires food and drink, so our mind is possessed with a becoming and natural desire to become acquainted with the truth of God and the causes of things.",
  "* But since, if the usefulness of the legislation, and the sequence and beauty of the history, were universally evident of itself, we should not believe that any other thing could be understood in the Scriptures save what was obvious, the word of God has arranged that certain stumbling-blocks, as it were, and offences, and impossibili\u00adties, should be introduced into the midst of the law and the history, in order that we may not, through being drawn away in all directions by the merely attractive na\u00adture of the language, either altogether fall away from the (true) doctrines, as learn\u00ading nothing worthy of God, or, by not departing from the letter, come to the knowledge of nothing more divine.",
  "* [W]ho that has understanding will sup\u00adpose that the first, and second, and third day, and the husbandman, planted a Cain also, when going forth from the presence of God, certainly appears to thoughtful men as likely to lead the reader to inquire what is the presence of God, and what is the meaning of going out from Him. ...",
  "* The reason why all those we have mentioned hold false opinions and make impious or ignorant assertions about God appears to be nothing else but this, that scripture is not understood in its spiritual sense, but is interpreted according to the bare letter.",
  "* As for the apostolic epistles, what person who is skilled in literary interpretation would think them to be plain and easily understood, when even in them there are thousands of passages that provide, as it through a window, a narrow opening leading to multitudes of the deepest thoughts?",
  "* One must therefore portray the meaning of the sacred writings in a threefold way upon ones own soul, so that the simple person may be edified by what we may call the flesh of the scripture, this name being given to the obvious interpretation; while the one who has made some progress may be edified by its soul, as it were; and the one who is perfect and like those mentioned by the apostle: \"We speak wisdom among the perfect; yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, which are coming to nought; but we speak Gods wisdom in a mystery, even the wisdom that has been hidden, which God foreordained before the world unto our glory\" (1 Cor. 2:6-7)--this one may be edified by the spiritual law, which has \"a shadow of the good things to come\" (cf. Rom. 7:14). For just as the human being consists of body, soul and spirit, so in the same way does the scripture, which has been prepared by God to be given for humanitys salvation.",
  "* When, therefore, as will be clear to those who read, the passage as a connected whole is literally impossible, whereas the outstanding part of it is not impossible but even true, the reader must endeavor to grasp the entire meaning, connecting by an intellectual process the account of what is literally impossible with the parts that are not impossible but historically true, these being interpreted allegorically in common with the part which, so far as the letter goes, did not happen at all. For our contention with regard to the whole of divine scripture is that it all has a spiritual meaning, but not all a bodily meaning; for the bodily meaning is often proved to be an impossibility.",
  "*The first point which Celsus brings forward, in his desire to throw discredit upon Christianity, is, that the Christians entered into secret associations with each other contrary to law, saying, that \u201cof associations some are public, and that these are in accordance with the laws; others, again, secret, and maintained in violation of the laws.\u201d  And his wish is to bring into disrepute what are termed the \u201clove-feasts\u201d of the Christians, as if they had their origin in the common danger, and were more binding than any oaths.  Since, then, he babbles about the public law, alleging that the associations of the Christians are in violation of it, we have to reply, that if a man were placed among Scythians, whose laws were unholy, and having no opportunity of escape, were compelled to live among them, such an one would with good reason, for the sake of the law of truth, which the Scythians would regard as atheistical polytheism, are \u201cScythian\u201d laws, or more impious even than these, if there be any such.  It is not irrational, then, to form associations in opposition to existing laws, if done for the sake of the truth.  For as those persons would do well who should enter into a secret association in order to put to death a tyrant who had seized upon the liberties of a state, so Christians also, when tyrannized over by him who is called the devil, and by falsehood, form leagues contrary to the laws of the devil, against his power, and for the safety of those others whom they may succeed in persuading to revolt from a government which is, as it were, \u201cScythian,\u201d and despotic.",
  "* And he asserts that certain\u00a0persons\u00a0who do not wish either to give or receive a reason for their belief, keep repeating,\u00a0\"Do not examine, but\u00a0believe!\"\u00a0and,\u00a0\"Your\u00a0faith\u00a0will save you!\"\u00a0And he alleges that such also say,\u00a0\"The wisdom of this life is bad, but that foolishness is a good thing!\"\u00a0To which we have to answer, that if it were possible for all to leave the business of life, and devote themselves to\u00a0philosophy, no other method ought to be adopted by any one, but this alone. For in the\u00a0Christian\u00a0system also it will be found that there is, not to speak at all arrogantly, at least as much of investigation into articles of belief, and of explanation of dark sayings, occurring in the prophetical writings, and of the\u00a0parables\u00a0in the\u00a0Gospels, and of countless other things, which either were narrated or enacted with a\u00a0symbolic\u00a0signification, (as is the case with other systems). But since the course alluded to is impossible, partly on account of the necessities of life, partly on account of the weakness of\u00a0men, as only a very few individuals devote themselves earnestly to study, what better method could be devised with a view of assisting the multitude, than that which was delivered by Jesus to the\u00a0heathen?",
  "*After these statements, Celsus, from a secret desire to cast discredit upon the Mosaic account of the creation, which teaches that the world is not yet ten thousand years old, but very much under that, while concealing his wish, intimates his agreement with those who hold that the world is uncreated. ",
  "*And if the Egyptians related fables of this kind, they are believed to convey a philosophical meaning by their enigmas and mysteries; but if allegorical meaning!",
  "*But let us now return to where the Jew is introduced, speaking of the mother of Jesus, and saying that \u201cwhen she was pregnant she was turned out of doors by the carpenter to whom she had been betrothed, as having been guilty of soldier named Panthera;\u201d and let us see whether those who have blindly concocted these fables about the adultery of the Virgin with Panthera, and her rejection by the carpenter, did not invent these stories to overturn His miraculous conception by the Holy Ghost:  for they could have falsified the Joseph that the Virgin conceived Jesus, rendered the falsehood very palpable to those who can understand and detect such inventions.  Is it at all agreeable to reason, that he who dared to do so much for the human race, in order that, as far as in him lay, all the Barbarians, who were looking for divine condemnation, might depart from evil, and regulate their entire conduct in a manner pleasing to the Creator of the world, should not have had a miraculous birth, but one the vilest and most disgraceful of all?  And I will ask of them as Greeks, and particularly of Celsus, who either holds or not the sentiments of Plato, and at any rate quotes them, whether He who sends souls down into the bodies of men, degraded Him who was to dare such mighty acts, and to teach so many men, and to reform so many from the mass of wickedness in the world, to a birth more disgraceful than any other, and did not rather introduce Him into the world through a lawful marriage?  Or is it not more in conformity with reason, that every soul, for certain mysterious reasons (I speak now according to the opinion of Pythagoras, and Plato, and Empedocles, whom Celsus frequently names), is introduced into a body, and introduced according to its deserts and former actions?  It is probable, therefore, that this soul also, which conferred more benefit by its residence in the flesh than that of many men (to avoid prejudice, I do not say \u201call\u201d), stood in need of a body not only superior to others, but invested with all excellent qualities.",
  "*For example, no one could easily persuade an Egyptian to despise what he had learned from his fathers, so as no longer to consider this or that irrational animal as a god, or not to guard against penalty of death, of the flesh of such an animal. ",
  "*And Jesus Himself, in raising the minds of His disciples to higher thoughts of the Son of God, says:  \u201cWhere two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of you.\u201d ([https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-20.htm Matt. xviii. 20])  And of the same nature is His promise to His disciples:  \u201cLo, I am with you alway, even to the end of the world.\u201d ([https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-20.htm Matt. xxviii. 20])  And we quote these passages, making no distinction between the Son of God and Jesus.  For the soul and body of Jesus formed, after the \u03bf\u1f30\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 , one being with the Logos of God.  Now if, according to Paul\u2019s teaching, \u201che that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit,\u201d ([https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-17.htm I Co vi. 17]) every one who understands what being joined to the Lord is, and who has been actually joined to Him, is one spirit with the Lord; how should not that being be one in a far greater and more divine degree, which was once united with the Logos of God?",
  "* In like manner, as the statement is false \"that the Hebrews, being (originally) Egyptians, dated the commencement (of their political existence) from the time of their rebellion,\" so also is this, \"that in the days of Jesus others who were Jews rebelled against the Jewish state, and became His followers;\" for neither Celsus nor they who think with him are able to point out any act on the part of Christians which savours of rebellion. And yet, if a revolt had led to the formation of the Christian commonwealth, so that it derived its existence in this way from that of the Jews, who were permitted to take up arms in defense of the members of their families, and to slay their enemies, the Christian Lawgiver would not have altogether forbidden the putting of men to death; and yet He nowhere teaches that it is right for His own disciples to offer violence to any one, however wicked. For He did not deem it in keeping with such laws as His, which were derived from a divine source, to allow the killing of any individual whatever. Nor would the Christians, had they owed their origin to a rebellion, have adopted laws of so exceedingly mild a character as not to allow them, when it was their fate to be slain as sheep, on any occasion to resist their persecutors. ",
  "* [Celsus] next imagines that, \u201cin worshipping him who,\u201d as he says, \u201cwas taken prisoner and put to death, we are acting like the Get\u00e6 who worship Zamolxis, and the Cilicians who worship Mopsus, and the Acarnanians who pay divine honours to Amphilochus, and like the Thebans who do the same to Amphiaraus, and the Lebadians to Trophonius.\u201d  Now in these instances we shall prove that he has compared us to the foregoing without good grounds.  For these different tribes erected temples and statues to those individuals above enumerated, whereas we have refrained from offering to the demons, which are somehow fixed in a certain place which they prefer to any other, or which take up their dwelling, as it were, after being removed (from one place to another) by certain rites and incantations), and are lost in reverential wonder at Jesus, who has recalled our minds from all sensible things, as being not only corruptible, but destined to corruption, and elevated them to honour the God who is over all with prayers and a righteous life, which we offer to Him as being intermediate between the nature of the uncreated and that of all created things, and who bestows upon us the benefits which come from the Father, and who as High Priest conveys our prayers to the supreme God.",
  "* But will not those narratives [concerning Christ], especially when they are understood in their proper sense, appear far more worthy of respect than the story that Dionysus was deceived by the Titans, and expelled from the throne of Jupiter, and torn in pieces by them, and his remains being afterwards put together again, he returned as it were once more to life, and ascended to heaven?  Or are the Greeks at liberty to refer such stories to the doctrine of the soul, and to interpret them figuratively, while the door of a consistent explanation, and one everywhere in accord and harmony with the writings of the Divine Spirit, who had His abode in pure souls, is closed against us? ",
  "*Will they who subdue that fierce longing for sexual pleasures which has reduced the souls of many to a weak and feeble condition, and who subdue it because they are persuaded that they cannot otherwise have communion with God, unless they ascend to Him through the exercise of temperance, appear to you to be the brothers of worms, and relatives of ants, and to bear a likeness to frogs?",
  "*And therefore, so far as we are concerned, the followers of Pythagoras, who abstain from all things that contain life may do as they please; only observe the different reason for abstaining from things that have life on the part of the Pythagoreans and our ascetics.  For the former abstain on account of the fable about the transmigration of souls, as the poet says:\u2014{{paragraph break}}\u201cAnd some one, lifting up his beloved son,{{paragraph break}}Will slay him after prayer; O how foolish he!\u201d{{paragraph break}}We, however, when we do abstain, do so because \u201cwe keep under our body, and bring it into subjection,\u201d (Cf. [https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-27.htm I Co. ix. 27]) and desire \u201cto mortify our members that are upon the earth, fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence;\u201d (Cf. [https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-5.htm Col. iii. 5]) and we use every effort to \u201cmortify the deeds of the flesh.\u201d (Cf. [https://biblehub.com/romans/8-13.htm Rom viii. 13])",
  "*And, further, who else could the destroying angel mentioned in the Exodus of Moses (Cf. [https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-23.htm  Exo. xii. 23]) be, than he who was the author of destruction to them that obeyed him, and did not withstand his wicked deeds, nor struggle against them?  Moreover (the goat), which in the Hebrew language is named Azazel, was none other than this; and it was necessary to send it away into the desert, and to treat it as an expiatory sacrifice, because on it the lot fell.  For all who belong to the \u201cworse\u201d part, on account of their wickedness, being opposed to those who are God\u2019s heritage, are deserted by God.",
  "*Nor is it at all wonderful if we maintain that the soul of Jesus is made one with so great a Son of God through the highest union with Him, being no longer in a state of separation from Him.  For the sacred language of holy Scripture knows of other things also, which, although \u201cdual\u201d in their own nature, are considered to be, and really are, \u201cone\u201d in respect to one another.  It is said of husband and wife, \u201cThey are no longer twain, but one flesh;\u201d (Cf. [https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-24.htm Gen. ii. 24]) and of the perfect man, and of him who is joined to the true Lord, Word, and Wisdom, and Truth, that \u201che who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.\u201d (Cf. [https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-17.htm I Co. vi. 17])  And if he who \u201cis joined to the Lord is one spirit,\u201d who has been joined to the Lord, the Very Word, and Wisdom, and Truth, and Righteousness, in a more intimate union, or even in a manner at all approaching to it than the soul of Jesus?  And if this be so, then the soul of Jesus and God the Word\u2014the first-born of every creature\u2014are no longer two, (but one).",
  "* There was no need that there should everywhere exist many bodies, and many spirits like Jesus, in order that the whole world of men might be enlightened by the Word of God. For the one Word was enough, having arisen as the \"Sun of righteousness ([https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-2.htm Mal. iv. 2]),\" to send forth from Judea His coming rays into the soul of all who were willing to receive Him. But if any one desires to see many bodies filled with a divine Spirit, similar to the one Christ, ministering to the salvation of men everywhere, let him take note of those who teach the gospel of Jesus in all lands in soundness of doctrine and uprightness of life, and who are themselves termed \"christs\" by the Holy Scriptures, in the passage, \"Touch not mine anointed, and do not my prophets any harm.\" For as we have heard that Antichrist cometh, and yet have learned that there are many antichrists in the world, in the same way, knowing that Christ has come, we see that, owing to Him, there are many christs in the world, who, like Him, have loved righteousness and hated iniquity, and therefore God, the God of Christ, anointed them also with the \"oil of gladness.\" But inasmuch as He loved righteousness and hated iniquity above those who were His partners, He also obtained the first-fruits of His anointing, and, if we must so term it, the entire unction of the oil of gladness ; while they who were His partners shared also in His unction, in proportion to their individual capacity.",
  "* He who honours the Son, who is the Word and Reason, acts in nowise contrary to reason, and gains for himself great good; he who honours Him, who is the Truth, becomes better by honouring truth:  and this we may say of honouring wisdom, righteousness, and all the other names by which the sacred Scriptures are wont to designate the Son of God.",
  "*Here I would observe that I cannot see how those whom he speaks of as abstaining from certain victims, in accordance with the traditions of their fathers, are consequently bound to abstain from the flesh of all animals.  We do not indeed deny that the divine word does seem to command something similar to this, when to raise us to a higher and purer life it says, \u201cIt is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor anything whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak;\u201d ([https://biblehub.com/romans/14-21.htm Rom. xiv. 21]) and again, \u201cDestroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died;\u201d([https://biblehub.com/romans/14-15.htm Rom. xiv. 15]) and again, \u201cIf meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.\u201d([https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-13.htm I Co. viii. 13])",
  "*And it may not be amiss, as bearing on this point, to recall a beautiful saying in the writings of Sextus, which is known to most Christians:  \u201cThe eating of animals,\u201d says he, \u201cis a matter of indifference; but to abstain from them is more agreeable to reason.\u201d"
