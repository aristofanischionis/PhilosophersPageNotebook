  "** When you counsel someone, you should appear to be reminding him of something he had forgotten, not of the light he was unable to see.",
  "** If you cannot make knowledge your servant, make it your friend.",
  "** Honorable beginnings should serve to awaken curiosity, not to heighten peoples expectations. We are much better off when reality surpasses our expectations, and something turns out better than we thought it would. This rule does not hold true for bad things: when an evil has been exaggerated, its reality makes people applaud. What was feared as ruinous comes to seem tolerable.",
  "** To overvalue something is a form of lying.",
  "** Readiness is the mother of luck.",
  "* Harto presto, si bien.",
  "** Many owe their greatness to their enemies. Flattery is fiercer than hatred, for hatred corrects the faults flattery had disguised.",
  "** Those who want to look like hard workers give the impression that they arent up to their jobs.",
  "** Politeness and a sense of honor have this advantage: we bestow them on others without losing a thing.",
  "** Complaints will always discredit you. Rather than compassion and consolation, they provoke passion and insolence, and encourage those who hear our complaints to behave like those we complain about. Once divulged to others, the offenses done to us seem to make others pardonable. Some complain of past offenses and give rise to future ones.",
  "** Not believing others implies that you yourself are deceitful. The liar suffers twice: he neither believes nor is believed.",
  "** Better to be cheated by the price than by the merchandise.",
  "** Knowing how to keep a friend is more important than gaining a new one.",
  "** The person who does not know how to put up with others should retire into himself, if indeed he can suffer even himself.",
  "** Because the ignorant do not know themselves, they never know for what they are lacking. Some would be sages if they did not believe they were so already.",
  "** Some die because they feel everything, others because they feel nothing. Some are fools because they suffer no regrets, and others because they do.",
  "** Trust the friends of today as though they will be the enemies of tomorrow.",
  "** Some marry the first information they receive, and turn what comes later into their concubine. Since deceit is always first to arrive, there is no room left for truth.",
  "** To hear a princes secrets is not a privilege but a burden. Many smash the mirror that reminds them of their ugliness. They cannot stand to see those who saw them.",
  "** The right kind of leisure is better than the wrong kind of work.",
  "** Some people belong entirely to others ... They have not a day, not an hour to call their own, so completely do they give themselves to others. This is true even in matters of understanding. Some people know everything for others and nothing for themselves.",
  "** Many pleasant things are better when they belong to someone else. ... When things belong to others, we enjoy them twice as much, without the risk of losing them, and with the pleasure of novelty.",
  "** Imagination travels faster than sight. Deceit comes in through the ears, but usually leaves through the eyes.",
  "** Freedom is more precious than the gift that makes us lose it.",
  "** Dont live by generalities, unless it be to act virtuously, and dont ask desire to follow precise laws, for you will have to drink tomorrow from the water you scorn today.",
  "** The one rule for pleasing: whet the appetite, keep people hungry.",
  "** Virtue alone is for real; all else is sham. Talent and greatness depend on virtue, not on fortune. Only virtue is sufficient unto herself. She makes us love the living and remember the dead."
