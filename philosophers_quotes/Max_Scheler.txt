  "* Ressentiment must therefore be strongest in a society like ours, where approximately equal rights (political and otherwise) or formal social equality, publicly recognized, go hand in hand with wide factual differences in power, property, and education.",
  "* It is peculiar to \u201cressentiment criticism\u201d that it does not seriously desire that its demands be fulfilled. It does not want to cure the evil. The evil is merely the pretext for the criticism.",
  "* Existential envy which is directed against the other person\u2019s very nature, is the strongest source of ressentiment. It is as if it whispers continually: \u201cI can forgive everything, but not that you are\u2014 that you are what you are\u2014that I am not what you are\u2014indeed that I am not you.\u201d This form of envy strips the opponent of his very existence, for this existence as such is felt to be a \u201cpressure,\u201d a \u201creproach,\u201d and an unbearable humiliation. In the lives of great men there are always critical periods of instability, in which they alternately envy and try to love those whose merits they cannot but esteem. Only gradually, one of these attitudes will predominate. Here lies the meaning of Goethe\u2019s reflection that \u201cagainst another\u2019s great merits, there is no remedy but love.\u201d",
  "* The \u201cnoble\u201d person has a completely na\u00efve and non-reflective awareness of his own value and of his fullness of being, an obscure conviction which enriches every conscious moment of his existence, as if he were autonomously rooted in the universe. This should not be mistaken for \u201cpride.\u201d Quite on the contrary, pride results from an experienced diminution of this \u201cnaive\u201d self-confidence. It is a way of \u201cholding on\u201d to one\u2019s value, of seizing and \u201cpreserving\u201d it deliberately. The noble man\u2019s naive self-confidence, which is as natural to him as tension is to the muscles, permits him calmly to assimilate the merits of others in all the fullness of their substance and configuration. He never \u201cgrudges\u201d them their merits. On the contrary: he rejoices in their virtues and feels that they make the world more worthy of love. His naive self-confidence is by no means \u201ccompounded\u201d of a series of positive valuations based on specific qualities, talents, and virtues: it is originally directed at his very essence and being. Therefore he can afford to admit that another person has certain \u201cqualities\u201d superior to his own or is more \u201cgifted\u201d in some respects\u2014indeed in all respects. Such a conclusion does not diminish his na\u00efve awareness of his own value, which needs no justification or proof by achievements or abilities. Achievements merely serve to confirm it. On the other hand, the \u201ccommon\u201d man (in the exact acceptation of the term) can only experience his value and that of another if he relates the two, and he clearly perceives only those qualities which constitute possible differences. The noble man experiences value prior to any comparison, the common man in and through a comparison. For the latter, the relation is the selective precondition for apprehending any value. Every value is a relative thing, \u201chigher\u201d or \u201clower,\u201d \u201cmore\u201d or \u201cless\u201d than his own. He arrives at value judgments by comparing himself to others and others to himself.",
  "* The ultimate goal of the arriviste\u2019s aspirations is not to acquire a thing of value, but to be more highly esteemed than others. He merely uses the \u201cthing\u201d as an indifferent occasion for overcoming the oppressive feeling of inferiority which results from his constant comparisons.",
  "* The medieval peasant prior to the 13th century does not compare himself to the feudal lord, nor does the artisan compare himself to the knight. \u2026 From the king down to the hangman and the prostitute, everyone is \u201cnoble\u201d in the sense that he considers himself as irreplaceable. In the \u201csystem of free competition,\u201d on the other hand, the notions on life\u2019s tasks and their value are not fundamental, they are but secondary derivations of the desire of all to surpass all the others. No \u201cplace\u201d is more than a transitory point in this universal chase.",
  "* If the awareness of our limitations begins to limit or to dim our value consciousness as well\u2014as happens, for instance, in old age with regard to the values of youth\u2014then we have already started the movement of devaluation which will end with the defamation of the world and all its values. Only a timely act of resignation can deliver us from this tendency toward self-delusion.",
  "* The \u201cold maid\u201d with her repressed cravings for tenderness, sex, and propagation, is rarely quite free of ressentiment. What we call \u201cprudery,\u201d in contrast with true modesty, is but one of the numerous variants of sexual ressentiment. The habitual behavior of many old maids, who obsessively ferret out all sexually significant events in their surroundings in order to condemn them harshly, is nothing but sexual gratification transformed into ressentiment satisfaction. Thus the criticism accomplishes the very thing it pretends to condemn.",
  "* The process of aging can only be fruitful and satisfactory if the important transitions are accompanied by free resignation, by the renunciation of the values proper to the preceding stage of life. Those spiritual and intellectual values which remain untouched by the process of aging, together with the values of the next stage of life, must compensate for what has been lost. Only if this happens can we cheerfully relive the values of our past in memory, without envy for the young to whom they are still accessible. If we cannot compensate, we avoid and flee the \u201ctormenting\u201d recollection of  youth, thus blocking our possibilities of understanding younger people. At the same time we tend to negate the specific values of earlier stages. No wonder that youth always has a hard fight to sustain against the ressentiment of the older generation",
  "* Even after his conversion, the true apostate is not primarily committed to the positive contents of his new belief and to the realization of its aims. He is motivated by the struggle against the old belief and lives on for its negation. The apostate does not affirm his new convictions for their own sake; he is engaged in a continuous chain of acts of revenge against his own spiritual past. In reality he remains a captive of this past, and the new faith is merely a handy frame of reference for negating and rejecting the old. As a religious type, the apostate is therefore at the opposite pole from the resurrected, whose life is transformed by a new faith which is full of intrinsic meaning and value.",
  "* To a lesser degree, a secret ressentiment underlies every way of thinking which attributes creative power to mere negation and criticism. Thus modern philosophy is deeply penetrated by a whole type of thinking which is nourished by ressentiment. I am referring to the view that the \u201ctrue\u201d and the \u201cgiven\u201d is not that which is self-evident, but rather that which is \u201cindubitable\u201d or \u201cincontestable,\u201d which can be maintained against doubt and criticism.",
  "* All the seemingly positive valuations and judgments of ressentiment are hidden devaluations and negations.",
  "* Whenever convictions are not arrived at by direct contact with the world and the objects themselves, but indirectly through a critique of the opinions of others, the processes of thinking are impregnated with ressentiment. The establishment of \u201ccriteria\u201d for testing the correctness of opinions then becomes the most important task. Genuine and fruitful criticism judges all opinions with reference to the object itself. Ressentiment criticism, on the contrary, accepts no \u201cobject\u201d that has not stood the test of criticism",
  "* Ressentiment is always to some degree a determinant of the romantic type of mind. At least this is so when the romantic nostalgia for some past era (Hellas, the Middle Ages, etc.) is not primarily based on the values of that period, but on the wish to escape from the present. Then all praise of the \u201cpast\u201d has the implied purpose of downgrading present-day reality.",
  "* We have a tendency to overcome any strong tension between desire and impotence by depreciating or denying the positive value of the desired object.",
  "* When we cannot obtain a thing, we comfort ourselves with the reassuring thought that it is not worth nearly as much as we believed.",
  "* To its very core, the mind of ressentiment man is filled with envy, the impulse to detract, malice, and secret vindictiveness. These affects have become fixed attitudes, detached from all determinate objects. Independently of his will, this man\u2019s attention will be instinctively drawn by all events which can set these affects in motion. The ressentiment attitude even plays a role in the formation of perceptions, expectations, and memories. It automatically selects those aspects of experience which can justify the factual application of this pattern of feeling.",
  "* The man of ressentiment cannot justify or even understand his own existence and sense of life in terms of positive values such as power, health, beauty, freedom, and independence. Weakness, fear, anxiety, and a slavish disposition prevent him from obtaining them. Therefore he comes to feel that \u201call this is vain anyway\u201d and that salvation lies in the opposite phenomena: poverty, suffering, illness, and death. This \u201csublime revenge\u201d of ressentiment  (in Nietzsche\u2019s words) has indeed played a creative role in the history of value systems. It is \u201csublime,\u201d for the impulses of revenge against those who are strong, healthy, rich, or handsome now disappear entirely. Ressentiment has brought deliverance from the inner torment of these affects. Once the sense of values has shifted and the new judgments have spread, such people cease to been viable, hateful, and worthy of revenge. They are unfortunate and to be pitied, for they are beset with \u201cevils.\u201d Their sight now awakens feelings of gentleness, pity, and commiseration. When the reversal of values comes to dominate accepted morality and is invested with the power of the ruling ethos, it is transmitted by tradition, suggestion, and education to those who are endowed with the seemingly devaluated qualities. They are struck with a \u201cbad conscience\u201d and secretly condemn themselves. The \u201cslaves,\u201d as Nietzsche says, infect the \u201cmasters.\u201d Ressentiment man, on the other hand, now feels \u201cgood,\u201d \u201cpure,\u201d and \u201chuman\u201d\u2014at least in the conscious layers of his mind. He is delivered from hatred, from the tormenting desire of an impossible revenge, though deep down his poisoned sense of life and the true values may still shine through the illusory ones. There is no more calumny, no more defamation of particular persons or things. The systematic perversion and reinterpretation of the values themselves is much more effective than the \u201cslandering\u201d of persons or the falsification of the world view could ever be.",
  "* Beyond all conscious lying and falsifying, there is a deeper \u201corganic mendacity.\u201d Here the falsification is not formed in consciousness, but at the same stage of the mental process as the impressions and value feelings themselves: on the road of experience into consciousness. There is \u201corganic mendacity\u201d whenever a man\u2019s mind admits only those impressions which serve his \u201cinterest\u201d or his instinctive attitude. Already in the process of mental reproduction and recollection, the contents of his experience are modified in this direction. He who is \u201cmendacious\u201d has no need to lie! In his case, the automatic process of forming recollections, impressions, and feelings is involuntarily slanted, so that conscious falsification becomes unnecessary.",
  "* All ancient philosophers, poets, and moralists agree that love is a striving, an aspiration of the \u201clower\u201d toward the \u201chigher,\u201d the \u201cunformed\u201d toward the \u201cformed,\u201d \u2026 \u201cappearance\u201d towards \u201cessence,\u201d \u201cignorance\u201d towards \u201cknowledge,\u201d a \u201cmean between fullness and privation,\u201d as Plato says in the Symposium. \u2026 The universe is a great chain of dynamic spiritual entities, of forms of being ranging from the \u201cprima materia\u201d up to man\u2014a chain in which the lower always strives for and is attracted by the higher, which never turns back but aspires upward in its turn. This process continues up to the deity, which itself does not love, but represents the eternally unmoving and unifying goal of all these aspirations of love. Too little attention has been given to the peculiar relation between this idea of love and the principle of the \u201cagon,\u201d the ambitious contest for the goal, which dominated Greek life in all its aspects\u2014from the Gymnasium and the games to dialectics and the political life of the Greek city states. Even the objects try to surpass each other in a race for victory, in a cosmic \u201cagon\u201d for the deity. Here the prize that will crown the victor is extreme: it is a participation in the essence, knowledge, and abundance of \u201cbeing.\u201d Love is only the dynamic principle, immanent in the universe, which sets in motion this great \u201cagon\u201d of all things for the deity.Let us compare this with the Christian conception. In that conception there takes place what might be called a reversal in the movement of love. The Christian view boldly denies the Greek axiom that love is an aspiration of the lower towards the higher. On the contrary, now the criterion of love is that the nobler stoops to the vulgar, the healthy to the sick, the rich to the poor, the handsome to the ugly, the good and saintly to the bad and common, the Messiah to the sinners and publicans. The Christian is not afraid, like the ancient, that he might lose something by doing so, that he might impair his own nobility. He acts in the peculiarly pious conviction that through this \u201ccondescension,\u201d through this self-abasement and \u201cself-renunciation\u201d he gains the highest good and becomes equal to God. \u2026 There is no longer any \u201chighest good\u201d independent of and beyond the act and movement of love! Love itself is the highest of all goods! The summum bonum is no longer the value of a thing, but of an act, the value of love itself as love\u2014not for its results and achievements. \u2026 Thus the picture has shifted immensely. This is no longer a band of men and things that surpass each other in striving up to the deity. It is a band in which every member looks back toward those who are further removed from God and comes to resemble the deity by helping and serving them.",
  "* There are two fundamentally different ways for the strong to bend down to the weak, for the rich to help the poor, for the more perfect life to help the \u201cless perfect.\u201d This action can be motivated by a powerful feeling of security, strength, and inner salvation, of the invincible fullness of one\u2019s own life and existence. All this unites into the clear awareness that one is rich enough to share one\u2019s being and possessions. Love, sacrifice, help, the descent to the small and the weak, here spring from a spontaneous overflow of force, accompanied by bliss and deep inner calm. Compared to this natural readiness for love and sacrifice, all specific \u201cegoism,\u201d the concern for oneself and one\u2019s interest, and even the instinct of \u201cself-preservation\u201d are signs of a blocked and weakened life. Life is essentially expansion, development, growth in plenitude, and not \u201cself-preservation,\u201d as a false doctrine has it. Development, expansion, and growth are not epiphenomena of mere preservative forces and cannot be reduced to the preservation of the \u201cbetter adapted.\u201d \u2026 There is a form of sacrifice which is a free renunciation of one\u2019s own vital abundance, a beautiful and natural overflow of one\u2019s forces. Every living being has a natural instinct of sympathy for other living beings, which increases with their proximity and similarity to himself. Thus we sacrifice ourselves for beings with whom we feel united and solidary, in contrast to everything \u201cdead.\u201d This sacrificial impulse is by no means a later acquisition of life, derived from originally egoistic urges. It is an original component of life and precedes all those particular \u201caims\u201d and \u201cgoals\u201d which calculation, intelligence, and reflection impose upon it later. We have an urge to sacrifice before we ever know why, for what, and for whom! Jesus\u2019 view of nature and life, which sometimes shines through his speeches and parables in fragments and hidden allusions, shows quite clearly that he understood this fact. When he tells us not to worry about eating and drinking, it is not because he is indifferent to life and its preservation, but because he sees also a vital weakness in all \u201cworrying\u201d about the next day, in all concentration on one\u2019s own physical well-being. \u2026 all voluntary concentration on one\u2019s own bodily wellbeing, all worry and anxiety, hampers rather than furthers the creative force which instinctively and beneficently governs all life. \u2026 This kind of indifference to the external means of life (food, clothing, etc.) is not a sign of indifference to life and its value, but rather of a profound and secret confidence in life\u2019s own vigor and of an inner security from the mechanical accidents which may befall it. A gay, light, bold, knightly indifference to external circumstances, drawn from the depth of life itself\u2014that is the feeling which inspires these words! Egoism and fear of death are signs of a declining, sick, and broken life. \u2026 This attitude is completely different from that of recent modern realism in art and literature, the exposure of social misery, the description of little people, the wallowing in the morbid\u2014a typical ressentiment phenomenon. Those people saw something bug-like in everything that lives, whereas Francis sees the holiness of \u201clife\u201d even in a bug.",
  "* In the ancient notion of love, on the other hand, there is an element of anxiety. The noble fears the descent to the less noble, is afraid of being infected and pulled down. The \u201csage\u201d of antiquity does not have the same firmness, the same inner certainty of himself and his own value, as the genius and hero of Christian love.",
  "* The fake love of ressentiment man offers no real help, since for his perverted sense of values, evils like \u201csickness\u201d and \u201cpoverty\u201d have become goods.",
  "* The important thing is not the amount of welfare, it is that there should be a maximum of love among men. The act of helping is the direct and adequate expression of love, not its meaning or \u201cpurpose.\u201d Its meaning lies in itself, in its illumination of the soul, in the nobility of the loving soul in the act of love. Therefore nothing can be further removed from this genuine concept of Christian love than all kinds of \u201csocialism,\u201d \u201csocial feeling,\u201d \u201caltruism,\u201d and other subaltern modern things. When the rich youth is told to divest himself of his riches and give them to the poor, it is really not in order to help the \u201cpoor\u201d and to effect a better distribution of property in the interest of general welfare. Nor is it because poverty as such is supposed to be better than wealth. The order is given because the act of giving away, and the spiritual freedom and abundance of love which manifest themselves in this act, ennoble the youth and make him even \u201cricher\u201d than he is.",
  "* Antiquity believed that the forces of love in the universe were limited. Therefore they were to be used sparingly,and everyone was to be loved only according to his value.",
  "* There is a completely different way of stooping to the small, the lowly, and the common, even though it may seem almost the same. Here love does not spring from an abundance of vital power, from firmness and security. Here it is only a euphemism for escape, for the inability to \u201cremain at home\u201d with oneself (chez soi). Turning toward others is but the secondary consequence of this urge to flee from oneself. \u2026 Modern philosophical jargon has found a revealing term for this phenomenon, one of the many modern substitutes for love: \u201caltruism.\u201d This love is not directed at a previously discovered positive value, nor does any such value flash up in the act of loving: there is nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people\u2019s business. We all know a certain type of man frequently found among socialists, suffragettes, and all people with an ever-ready \u201csocial conscience\u201d\u2014the kind of person whose social activity is quite clearly prompted by inability to keep his attention focused on himself, on his own tasks and problems.",
  "* It is precisely the essential feature of egoism that it does not apprehend the full value of the isolated self. The egoist sees himself only with regard to the others, as a member of society who wishes to possess and acquire more than the others. Self-directedness or other-directedness have no essential bearing on the specific quality of love or hatred. These acts are different in themselves, quite independently of their direction",
  "* In ressentiment morality, love for the \u201csmall,\u201d the \u201cpoor,\u201d the \u201cweak,\u201d and the \u201coppressed\u201d is really disguised hatred, repressed envy, an impulse to detract, etc., directed against the opposite phenomena: \u201cwealth,\u201d \u201cstrength,\u201d \u201cpower,\u201d \u201clargesse.\u201d When hatred does not dare to come out into the open, it can be easily expressed in the form of ostensible love\u2014love for something which has features that are the opposite of those of the hated object. This can happen in such a way that the hatred remains secret. When we hear that falsely pious, unctuous tone (it is the tone of a certain \u201csocially-minded\u201d type of priest), sermonizing that love for the \u201csmall\u201d is our first duty, love for the \u201chumble\u201d inspirit, since God gives \u201cgrace\u201d to them, then it is often only hatred posing as Christian love. ",
  "* When we are told, in the same tone, that these people will be rewarded in \u201cheaven\u201d for their distress, and that \u201cheaven\u201d is the exact reverse of the earthly order (\u201cthe first shall be last\u201d), we distinctly feel how the ressentiment-laden man transfers to God the vengeance he himself cannot wreak on the great. In this way, he can satisfy his revenge at least in imagination, with the aid of an other-worldly mechanism of rewards and punishments.",
  "* The \u201ckingdom of God\u201d has become the \u201cother world,\u201d which stands mechanically beside \u201cthis world\u201d\u2014an opposition unknown to the strongest periods of Christianity.",
  "* The highest and ultimate personality values are declared to be independent of contrasts like rich and poor, healthy and sick, etc. The world had become accustomed to considering the social hierarchy, based on status, wealth, vital strength, and power, as an exact image of the ultimate values of morality and personality. The only way to disclose the discovery of anew and higher sphere of being and life, of the \u201ckingdom of God\u201d whose order is independent of that worldly and vital hierarchy, was to stress the vanity of the old values in this higher order.",
  "* The precepts \u201cLove your enemies, do good to them which hate you, bless them that curse you\u201d \u2026 are born from the Gospel\u2019s profound spirit of individualism, which refuses to let one\u2019s own actions and conduct depend in any way on somebody else\u2019s acts. The Christian refuses to let his acts be mere reactions\u2014such conduct would lower him to the level of his enemy. The act is to grow organically from the person, \u201cas the fruit from the tree.\u201d \u2026 What the Gospel demands is not a reaction which is the reverse of the natural reaction, as if it said: \u201cBecause he strikes you on the cheek, tend the other\u201d\u2014but a rejection of all reactive activity, of any participation in common and average ways of acting and standards of judgment.",
  "* Jesus\u2019 \u201cmysterious\u201d affection for the sinners, which is closely related to his ever-ready militancy against the scribes and pharisees, against every kind of social respectability \u2026 contains a kind of awareness that the great transformation of life, the radical change in outlook he demands of man (in Christian parlance it is called \u201crebirth\u201d) is more accessible to the sinner than to the \u201cjust.\u201d \u2026 Jesus is deeply skeptical toward all those who can feign the good man\u2019s blissful existence through the simple lack of strong instincts and vitality. But all this does not suffice to explain this mysterious affection. In it there is something which can scarcely be expressed and must be felt. When the noblest men are in the company of the \u201cgood\u201d\u2014even of the truly \u201cgood,\u201d not only of the pharisees\u2014they are often overcome by a sudden impetuous yearning to go to the sinners, to suffer and struggle at their side and to share their grievous, gloomy lives. This is truly no temptation by the pleasures of sin, nor a demoniacal love for its \u201csweetness,\u201d nor the attraction of the forbidden or the lure of novel experiences. It is an outburst of tempestuous love and tempestuous compassion for all men who are felt as one, indeed for the universe as a whole; a love which makes it seem frightful that only some should be \u201cgood,\u201d while the others are \u201cbad\u201d and reprobate. In such moments, love and a deep sense of solidarity are repelled by the thought that we alone should be \u201cgood,\u201d together with some others. This fills us with a kind of loathing for those who can accept this privilege, and we have an urge to move away from them.",
  "*Thirst for revenge is the most important source of ressentiment. As we have seen, the very term \u201cressentiment\u201d indicates that we have to do with reactions which presuppose the previous apprehension of another persons state of mind. The desire for revenge\u2014in contrast with all active and aggressive impulses, be they friendly or hostile\u2014is also such a reactive impulse. It is always preceded by an attack or an injury. Yet it must be clearly distinguished from the impulse for reprisals or self-defense, even when this reaction is accompanied by anger, fury, or indignation. If an animal bites its attacker, this cannot be called \u201crevenge.\u201d Nor does an immediate reprisal against a box on the ear fall under this heading. Revenge is distinguished by two essential characteristics. First of all, the immediate reactive impulse, with the accompanying emotions of anger and rage, is temporarily or at least momentarily checked and restrained, and the response is consequently postponed to a later time and to a more suitable occasion (\u201cjust wait till next time\u201d). This blockage is caused by the reflection that an immediate reaction would lead to defeat, and by a concomitant pronounced feeling of \u201cinability\u201d and \u201cimpotence.\u201d Thus even revenge as such, based as it is upon an experience of impotence, is always primarily a matter of those who are \u201cweak\u201d in some respect. Furthermore, it is of the essence of revenge that it always contains the *consciousness* of \u201ctit for tat,\u201d so that it is never a mere emotional reaction.",
  "*These two characteristics make revenge the most suitable source for the formation of ressentiment. The nuances of language are precise. There is a progression of feeling which starts with revenge and runs via rancor, envy, and impulse to detract all the way to spite, coming close to ressentiment. Usually, revenge and envy still have specific objects. They do not arise without special reasons and are directed against definite objects, so that they do not outlast their motives. The desire for revenge disappears when vengeance has been taken, when the person against whom it was directed has been punished or has punished himself, or when one truly forgives him. In the same way, envy vanishes when the envied possession becomes ours. The impulse to detract, however, is not in the same sense tied to definite objects\u2014it does not arise through specific causes with which it disappears. On the contrary, this affect seeks those objects, those aspects of men and things, from which it can draw gratification. It likes to disparage and to smash pedestals, to dwell on the negative aspects of excellent men and things, exulting in the fact that such faults are more perceptible through their contrast with the strongly positive qualities. Thus there is set a fixed pattern of experience which can accommodate the most diverse contents. This form or structure fashions each concrete experience of life and selects it from possible experiences. The impulse to detract, therefore, is no mere result of such an experience, and the experience will arise regardless of considerations whether its object could in any way, directly or indirectly, further or hamper the individual concerned. In \u201cspite,\u201d this impulse has become even more profound and deep-seated\u2014it is, as it were, always ready to burst forth and to betray itself in an unbridled gesture, a way of smiling, etc. An analogous road leads from simple *Schadenfreude* to \u201cmalice.\u201d The latter, more detached than the former from definite objects, tries to bring about ever new opportunities for *Schadenfreude*.",
  "*Yet all this is not ressentiment. These are only stages in the development of its sources. Revenge, envy, the impulse to detract, spite, *Schadenfreude*, and malice lead to ressentiment only if there occurs neither a moral self-conquest (such as genuine forgiveness in the case of revenge) nor an act or some other adequate expression of emotion (such as verbal abuse or shaking ones fist), and if this restraint is caused by a pronounced awareness of impotence. There will be no ressentiment if he who thirsts for revenge really acts and avenges himself, if he who is consumed by hatred harms his enemy, gives him \u201ca piece of his mind,\u201d or even merely vents his spleen in the presence of others. Nor will the envious fall under the dominion of ressentiment if he seeks to acquire the envied possession by means of work, barter, crime, or violence. Ressentiment can only arise if these emotions are particularly powerful and yet must be suppressed because they are coupled with the feeling that one is unable to act them out\u2014either because of weakness, physical or mental, or because of fear. Through its very origin, ressentiment is therefore chiefly confined to those who serve and are dominated at the moment, who fruitlessly resent the sting of authority. When it occurs elsewhere, it is either due to psychological contagion\u2014and the spiritual venom of ressentiment is extremely contagious\u2014or to the violent suppression of an impulse which subsequently revolts by \u201cembittering\u201d and \u201cpoisoning\u201d the personality. If an ill-treated servant can vent his spleen in the antechamber, he will remain free from the inner venom of ressentiment, but it will engulf him if he must hide his feelings and keep his negative and hostile emotions to himself.",
  "* Impulses of revenge lead to ressentiment the more they change into actual *vindictiveness*, the more their direction shifts toward indeterminate groups of objects which need only share one common characteristic, and the less they are satisfied by vengeance taken on a specific object. If the desire for revenge remains permanently unsatisfied, and especially if the feeling of \u201cbeing right (lacking in an outburst of rage, but an integral part of revenge) is intensified into the idea of a \u201cduty,\u201d the individual may actually wither away and die. The vindictive person is instinctively and without a conscious act of volition drawn toward events which may give rise to vengefulness, or he tends to see injurious intentions in all kinds of perfectly innocent actions and remarks of others. Great touchiness is indeed frequently a symptom of a vengeful character. The vindictive person is always in search of objects, and in fact he attacks\u2014in the belief that he is simply wreaking vengeance. This vengeance restores his damaged feeling of personal value, his injured \u201chonor,\u201d or it brings \u201csatisfaction\u201d for the wrongs he has endured. When it is repressed, vindictiveness leads to ressentiment , a process which is intensified when the *imagination* of vengeance, too, is repressed\u2014and finally the very emotion of revenge itself. Only then does this *state of mind* become associated with the tendency to detract from the other persons value, which brings an illusory easing of the tension.\"",
  "* \"There is usually no ressentiment just where a superficial view would look for it first: in the criminal. The criminal is essentially an active type. Instead of repressing hatred, revenge, envy, and greed, he releases them in crime. Ressentiment is a basic impulse only in the crimes of spite. These are crimes which require only a minimum of action and risk and from which the criminal draws no advantage, since they are inspired by nothing but the desire to do harm. The arsonist is the purest type in point, provided that he is not motivated by the pathological urge of watching fire (a rare case) or by the wish to collect insurance. Criminals of this type strangely resemble each other. Usually they are quiet, taciturn, shy, quite settled and hostile to all alcoholic or other excesses. Their criminal act is nearly always a sudden outburst of impulses of revenge or envy which have been repressed for years. A typical cause would be the continual deflation of ones ego by the constant sight of the neighbors rich and beautiful farm. Certain expressions of class ressentiment, which have lately been on the increase, also fall under this heading. I mention a crime committed near Berlin in 1912: in the darkness, the criminal stretched a wire between two trees across the road, so that the heads of passing automobilists would be shorn off. This is a typical case of ressentiment, for any car driver or passenger at all could be the victim, and there is no interested motive. Also in cases of slander and defamation of character, ressentiment often plays a major role. . .\"",
  "* \"Among the types of human activity which have always played a role in history, the soldier is least subject to ressentiment. Nietzsche is right in pointing out that the priest is most exposed to this danger, though the conclusions about religious morality which he draws from this insight are inadmissible. It is true that the very requirements of his profession, quite apart from his individual or national temperament, expose the priest more than any other human type to the creeping poison of ressentiment. In principle he is not supported by secular power; indeed he affirms the fundamental weakness of such power. Yet, as the representative of a concrete institution, he is to be sharply distinguished from the homo religiosus\u2014he is placed in the middle of party struggle. More than any other man, he is condemned to control his emotions (revenge, wrath, hatred) at least outwardly, for he must always represent the image and principle of \u201cpeacefulness.\u201d The typical \u201cpriestly policy\u201d of gaining victories through suffering rather than combat, or through the counterforces which the sight of the priests suffering produces in men who believe that he unites them with God, is inspired by ressentiment. There is no trace of ressentiment in genuine martyrdom; only the false martyrdom of priestly policy is guided by it. This danger is completely avoided only when priest and homo religiosus coincide.\"",
  "* \"This law of the release of tension through illusory valuation gains new significance, full of infinite consequences, for the ressentiment attitude. To its very core, the mind of ressentiment man is filled with envy, the impulse to detract, malice, and secret vindictiveness. These affects have become fixed attitudes, detached from all determinate objects. Independently of his will, this mans attention will be instinctively drawn by all events which can set these affects in motion. The ressentiment attitude even plays a role in the formation of perceptions, expectations, and memories. It automatically selects those aspects of experience which can justify the factual application of this pattern of feeling. Therefore such phenomena as joy, splendor, power, happiness, fortune, and strength magically attract the man of ressentiment. He cannot pass by, he has to look at them, whether he \u201cwants\u201d to or not. But at the same time he wants to avert his eyes, for he is tormented by the craving to possess them and knows that his desire is vain. The first result of this inner process is a characteristic falsification of the world view. Regardless of what he observes, his world has a peculiar structure of emotional stress. The more the impulse to turn away from those positive values prevails, the more he turns without transition to their negative opposites, on which he concentrates increasingly. He has an urge to scold, to depreciate, to belittle whatever he can. Thus he involuntarily \u201cslanders\u201d life and the world in order to justify his inner pattern of value experience.",
  "* But this instinctive falsification of the world view is only of limited effectiveness. Again and again the ressentiment man encounters happiness, power, beauty, wit, goodness, and other phenomena of positive life. They exist and impose themselves, however much he may shake his fist against them and try to explain them away. He cannot escape the tormenting conflict between desire and impotence. Averting his eyes is sometimes impossible and in the long run ineffective. When such a quality irresistibly forces itself upon his attention, the very sight suffices to produce an impulse of hatred against its bearer, who has never harmed or insulted him. Dwarfs and cripples, who already feel humiliated by the outward appearance of the others, often show this peculiar hatred\u2014this hyena-like and ever-ready ferocity. Precisely because this kind of hostility is not caused by the \u201cenemys\u201d actions and behavior, it is deeper and more irreconcilable than any other. It is not directed against transitory attributes, but against the other persons very essence and being. Goethe has this type of \u201cenemy\u201d in mind when he writes: \u201cWhy complain about enemies?\u2014Could those become your friends\u2014To whom your very existence\u2014Is an eternal silent reproach?\u201d (West-Eastern Divan). The very existence of this \u201cbeing,\u201d his mere appearance, becomes a silent, unadmitted \u201creproach.\u201d Other disputes can be settled, but not this! Goethe knew, for his rich and great existence was the ideal target of ressentiment. His very appearance was bound to make the poison flow. ",
  "* But even this apparently unfounded hatred is not yet the most characteristic achievement of ressentiment. Even here, it is still directed against particular persons or (as in class hatred) particular groups. Its effect is much more profound when it goes beyond such determinate hostilities\u2014when it does not lead to a falsification of the world view, but perverts the sense of values itself. What Nietzsche calls \u201cfalsification of the tablets of value\u201d is built on this foundation. In this new phase, the man of ressentiment no longer turns away from the positive values, nor does he wish to destroy the men and things endowed with them. Now the values themselves are inverted: those values which are positive to any normal feeling become negative. The man of ressentiment cannot justify or even understand his own existence and sense of life in terms of positive values such as power, health, beauty, freedom, and independence. Weakness, fear, anxiety, and a slavish disposition prevent him from obtaining them. Therefore he comes to feel that \u201call this is vain anyway\u201d and that salvation lies in the opposite phenomena: poverty, suffering, illness, and death.",
  "* This \u201csublime revenge\u201d of ressentiment (in Nietzsches words) has indeed played a creative role in the history of value systems. It is \u201csublime,\u201d for the impulses of revenge against those who are strong, healthy, rich, or handsome now disappear entirely. Ressentiment has brought deliverance from the inner torment of these affects. Once the sense of values has shifted and the new judgments have spread, such people cease to be enviable, hateful, and worthy of revenge. They are unfortunate and to be pitied, for they are beset with \u201cevils.\u201d Their sight now awakens feelings of gentleness, pity, and commiseration. When the reversal of values comes to dominate accepted morality and is invested with the power of the ruling ethos, it is transmitted by tradition, suggestion, and education to those who are endowed with the seemingly devaluated qualities. They are struck with a \u201cbad conscience\u201d and secretly condemn themselves. The \u201cslaves,\u201d as Nietzsche says, infect the \u201cmasters.\u201d Ressentiment man, on the other hand, now feels \u201cgood,\u201d \u201cpure,\u201d and \u201chuman\u201d\u2014at least in the conscious layers of his mind. He is delivered from hatred, from the tormenting desire of an impossible revenge, though deep down his poisoned sense of life and the true values may still shine through the illusory ones. There is no more calumny, no more defamation of particular persons or things. The systematic perversion and reinterpretation of the values themselves is much more effective than the \u201cslandering\u201d of persons or the falsification of the world view could ever be.\"",
  "* One cannot love anybody without turning away from oneself. However, the crucial question is whether this movement is prompted by the desire to turn toward a positive value, or whether the intention is a radical escape from oneself. \u201cLove\u201d of the second variety is inspired by self-hatred, by hatred of one\u2019s own weakness and misery. The mind is always on the point of departing for distant places. Afraid of seeing itself and its inferiority, it is driven to give itself to the other\u2014not because of his worth, but merely for the sake of his \u201cotherness.\u201d Modern philosophical jargon has found a revealing term for this phenomenon, one of the many modern substitutes for love: \u201caltruism.\u201d This love is not directed at a previously discovered positive value, nor does any such value flash up in the act of loving: there is nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people\u2019s business. We all know a certain type of man frequently found among socialists, suffragettes, and all people with an ever-ready \u201csocial conscience\u201d\u2014 the kind of person whose social activity is quite clearly prompted by inability to keep his attention focused on himself, on his own tasks and problems. Looking away from oneself is here mistaken for love! Isn\u2019t it abundantly clear that \u201caltruism,\u201d the interest in \u201cothers\u201d and their lives, has nothing at all to do with love? The malicious or envious person also forgets his own interest, even his \u201cpreservation.\u201d He only thinks about the other man\u2019s feelings, about the harm and the suffering he inflicts on him. Conversely, there is a form of genuine \u201cself-love\u201d which has nothing at all to do with \u201cegoism.\u201d It is precisely the essential feature of egoism that it does not apprehend the full value of the isolated self. The egoist sees himself only with regard to the others, as a member of society who wishes to possess and acquire more than the others. Selfdirectedness or other-directedness have no essential bearing on the specific quality of love or hatred. These acts are different in themselves, quite independently of their direction."
