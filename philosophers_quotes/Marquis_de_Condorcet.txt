  "* Enjoy your life without comparing to that of others. It is enough for you to know that you are good, without examining whether others are as good as you.",
  "* Has not printing freed the education of the people from all political and religious shackles? It would be vain for any despotism to invade all the schools ... The instruction that every man is free to receive from books in silence and solitude can never be completely corrupted. It is enough for there to exist one corner of free earth from which the press can scatter its leaves. How with the multitude of different books, with the innumerable copies of each book, of reprints that can be made available at a moment\u2019s notice, how could it be possible to bolt every door, to seal every crevice through which truth aspires to enter?"
