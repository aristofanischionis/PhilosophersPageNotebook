  "* In the same way as philosophy loses sight of its true object and appropriate matter, when either it passes into and merges in theology, or meddles with external politics, so also does it mar its proper form when it attempts to mimic the rigorous method of mathematics.",
  "* In England \u2026 everything becomes professional \u2026 even the rogues of that island are pedants.",
  "* Poetry can be criticized only through poetry. A critique which itself is not a work of art, either in content as representation of the necessary impression in the process of creation, or through its beautiful form and in its liberal tone in the spirit of the old Roman satire, has no right of citizenship in the realm of art. ",
  "** Novels are the Socratic dialogs of our time. This free form has become the refuge of common sense in its flight from pedantry.",
  "* Whoever hasn\u2019t yet arrived at the clear realization that there might be a greatness existing entirely outside his own sphere and for which he might have absolutely no feeling; whoever hasn\u2019t at least felt obscure intimations concerning the approximate location of this greatness in the geography of the human spirit: that person either has no genius in his own sphere, or else he hasn\u2019t been educated to the level of the classic.",
  "** At the words \u201chis philosophy, my philosophy,\u201d one is always reminded of that line in Nathan: \u2026 \u201cWhat kind of God is it who belongs to a man?\u201d ",
  "* Romantic poetry \u2026 recognizes as its first commandment that the will of the poet can tolerate no law above itself.",
  "* To live classically and to realize antiquity practically within oneself is the summit and goal of philology.",
  "** To disrespect the masses is moral; to honor them, lawful.",

  "** A mediator is one who perceives the divinity within himself and who self-destructively sacrifices himself in order to reveal, communicate, and represent to all mankind this divinity in his conduct and actions, in his words and works.",
  "** An artist is someone who carries his center within himself. Whoever lacks such a center has to choose some particular leader and mediator outside of himself.",
  "** To give the community of artists a particular purpose would mean \u2026 debasing the community of saints into a state.",
  "** The artist should have as little desire to rule as to serve. He can only create, do nothing but create, and so help the state only by \u2026 exalting politicians and economists into artists.",
  "** It is individuality which is the original and eternal within man; personality doesn\u2019t matter so much. To pursue the education and development of this individuality as one\u2019s highest vocation would be a divine egoism.",
  "** One has only as much morality as one has philosophy and poetry.",
  "** Through artists mankind becomes an individual, in that they unite the past and the future in the present. They are the higher organ of the soul, where the life spirits of entire external mankind meet and in which inner mankind first acts.",

  "* Expect nothing more from philosophy than a voice, language and grammar of the instinct for Godliness that lies at its origin, and, essentially, is philosophy itself.",
  "* When one considers the sublime disposition underlying the tmly universal educatiOn (of traditional India) ... then what IS or has been called religion in Europe seems to us to be scarcely deserving of that name. And one feels compelled to advise those who Wish to witness religion to travel to India for that purpose .... ",
  "* India is not only at the origin of everything, she is superior in everything, intellectually, religiously or politically and even the Greek heritage seems pale in comparison.",
  "* The divine origin of man, as taught by Vedanta, IS continually inculcated, to stimulate his efforts to return, to animate him in the struggle, and incite him to consider a reunion and reincorporation with Divinity as the one primary object of every action and reaction. Even the loftiest philosophy of the European, the idealism of reason as it is set forth by the Greek philosophers, appears in comparison with the abundant light and vigor of Oriental idealism like a feeble Promethean spark in the full flood of heavenly glory of the noonday sun, faltering and feeble and ever ready to be extinguished.",
  "* In India lay the real source of all tongues, of all thoughts and utterances of the human mind. Everything - yes, everything without exception - has it origin in India.\" and \"The primary source of all intellectual development - in a word the whole human culture - is unquestionably to be found in the tradItions of the East.

  "* The doctrine of the transmigration of souls was indigenous to India and was brought into Greece by Pythagoras.",
  "* Germany had no material interests and responded spiritually to India. Friedrich Schlegel, hailed as \u201cthe inventor of the Oriental Renaissance,\u201d wrote in 1803, \u201cEverything, yes, everything without exception has its origin in India.\u201d He proclaimed India with Greece and Germany, the most philosophical of nations. \u201cIf one considers,\u201d he said, \u201cthe superior conception which is at the basis of the truly universal Indian culture and which, itself divine, knows how to embrace in its universality everything that is divine without distinction, then, what we in Europe call religion or what we used to call such, no longer seems to deserve that name. And one would like to advice everyone who wants to see religion, he should, just as one goes to Italy to study art, go to India for that purpose where he may be certain to find at least fragments for which he will surely look in vain in Europe.\u201d Friedrich Schlegel\u2019s The Language and Wisdom of the Indians (1808) was the first German contribution to Indology. Friedrich wrote, \u201cMay Indic studies find as many disciples and protectors as Germany and Italy saw spring up in such great numbers for Greek studies in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and may they be able to do as many things in as short a time. The Renaissance of antiquity promptly transformed and rejuvenated all the sciences; we might add that it rejuvenated and transformed the world. We could even say that the effects of Indic studies, if these enterprises were taken up and introduced into learned circles with the same energy today, would be no less great or far-reaching.\u201d ",
  "**  The historian is a reversed prophet.",
  "** The Satan of the Italian and English poets may be poetic; but the German Satan is satanic; and thus one could say that Satan is a German invention.",
  "** If there is an invisible church, then it is of the great paradox, which is inseparable from morality, and which must be distinguished from the merely philosophical. People who are so eccentric that they are completely serious in being and becoming virtuous understand one another in everything, find one another easily, and form a silent opposition against the prevailing immorality that pretends to be morality. A certain mysticism of expression, which joined with romantic fantasy and grammatical understanding, can be something charming and good, often serves as a symbol of their beautiful secrets.",
  "* Prudishness is pretense of innocence without innocence. Women have to remain prudish as long as men are sentimental, dense, and evil enough to demand of them eternal innocence and lack of education. For innocence is the only thing which can ennoble lack of education. ",

  "* Moderation is the spirit of castrated narrow-mindedness.",
  "* Whoever does not philosophize for the sake of philosophy, but rather uses philosophy as a means, is a sophist.",
  "** As a transitional condition, skepticism is logical insurrection; as a system, it is anarchy. Skeptical method would therefore be much the same as rule by insurgents.",
  "* Religion is usually nothing but a supplement to or even a substitute for education, and nothing is religious in the strict sense which is not a product of freedom.",
  "**Aphorisms are the true form of the universal philosophy.",
  "* The most important subject, and the first problem of philosophy, is the restoration in man of the lost image of God; so far as this relates to science.Should this restoration in the internal consciousness be fully understood, and really brought about, the object of pure philosophy is attained.",
  "* To point out historically... the progress of this restoration in the various periods of the world, constitutes the object of the \"Philosophy of History.\"",
  "* This perception\u2014this comprehension\u2014this right discernment of the great events and general results of universal history, is what might be termed a science of history; and I would have here preferred that term, were it not liable to much misconception, and might have been understood as referring more to special and learned inquiries, than the other name I have adopted...",
  "* [A]ll those countless battles\u2014those endless, and... for the greater part, useless wars, of which... fills up for so many thousand years... are but little atoms compared with the great whole of human destiny.",
  "* The first fundamental rule of historical science and research, when by these is sought a knowledge of the general destinies of mankind, is to keep these, and every object connected with them, steadily in view, without losing ourselves in the details of special inquiries and particular facts, for the multitude and variety of these subjects is absolutely boundless; and on the ocean of historical science the main subject easily vanishes from the eye. ...In the higher grades of academic instruction, the lessons on history must vary with each ones calling and pursuits ...[T]he archives of many a state would alone furnish occupation for more than a mans life. ...The first fundamental rule ...to keep the attention fixed on the main subject, and not to let it be distracted or dissipated by a number of minute details\u2014concerned more the method of historical science. The second rule regards the subject and purport of history... [W]e should not wish to explain every thing. Historical tradition must never be abandoned in the {{w|philosophy of history}}\u2014otherwise we lose all firm ground and footing... [W]e have nothing to do but to record, as it is given, the best and safest testimony which tradition, so far as we have it, can afford... Extremely hazardous is the desire to explain every thing, and to supply whatever appears a gap in history\u2014for in this propensity lies the first cause and germ of all those violent and arbitrary hypotheses which perplex and pervert the science of history far more than the open avowal of our ignorance, or the uncertainty of our knowledge: hypotheses which give an oblique direction, or an exaggerated and false extension to a view of the subject originally not incorrect. And even if there are points which appear not very clear to us, or which we leave unexplained\u2014this will not prevent us from comprehending, so far... as the limited conception of man is able, the great outline of human history, though here and there a gap should remain."
