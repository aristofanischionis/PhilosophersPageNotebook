  "* Death has no terrors for a sincere servant of Christ who is laboring to bring souls to a knowledge of the truth.",
  "* If understanding followed no rule at all, there would be no good in the understanding nor in the matter understood, and to remain in ignorance would be the greatest good.",
  "** Every woman is worth more when she learns to read."
