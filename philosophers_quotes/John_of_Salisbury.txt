  "** Bernard of Chartres used to say that we were like dwarfs seated on the shoulders of giants.  If we see more and further than they, it is not due to our own clear eyes or tall bodies, but because we are raised on high and upborne by their gigantic bigness.",
  "** Between a tyrant and a prince there is this single or chief difference, that the latter obeys the law and rules the people by its dictates, accounting himself as but their servant.",
  "** Accurate reading on a wide range of subjects makes the scholar; careful selection of the better makes the saint.",
  "** A man is free in proportion to the measure of his virtues, and the extent to which he is free determines what his virtues can accomplish.",
  "** wrongdoing.",
  "* These Peripatetics accordingly made careful investigations into the nature of all things, so as to determine which I should be avoided as evil, discounted as useless, sought after as good,or preferred as better, and finally which are called \"good\" or \"bad\" according to circumstances. There thus developed two branches of philosophy, natural and moral, which are also called ethics and physics. But, through lack of scientific skill in argumentative reasoning, many absurdities were concluded. Thus Epicurus would have the world originate from atoms and a void, and would dispense with God as its author; whereas the Stoics asserted that matter is coeternal with God, and held that all sins are equally grave. p. 76",
  "* To say that a thing \"wholly pertains\" to something else, or \"does not pertain to it in any way,\" and that something \"is predicated in a universal way\" of something else, or \"is completely alien to it\" amount to the same thing. Nevertheless, while one form of expression is [now] in frequent use, the other has become practically obsolete, except so far as it may occasionally be admitted through mutual agreement. In Aristotles day it was perhaps customary to use both of these forms of expression, but now one has replaced the other [simply] because usage has so decreed. p. 168",
  "* Faith is, indeed, most necessary in human affairs, as well as in religion Without faith, no contracts could be concluded, nor could any business be transacted. And without faith, where would be the basis for the divine reward of human merit? As it is, that faith which embraces the truths of religion deserves reward. Such faith is, according to the Apostle, \"a substantiation of things to be hoped for, a testimonial to things that appear not.\" Faith is intermediate between opinion and science. p. 223"
