  "* \"Zhengchun said, \u201cI\u2019d like to survey a great many books.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d Zhu Xi said. \u201cRead one book thoroughly, then read another one. If you confusedly try to advance on several fronts, you will end up with difficulties. It\u2019s like archery. If you are strong enough for a five-pint bow, use a four-pint one. You will be able to draw it all the way and still have strength left over. Students today do not measure their own strength when reading books. I worry that we cannot manage what we already have set ourselves.\u201d 20:464{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/27226697|title=Chinese civilization : a sourcebook|last=Ebrey|first=Patricia Buckley|date=|publisher=The Free Press|others=|year=1993|isbn=002908752X|edition=2nd ed|location=New York|pages=172 - 8|oclc=27226697}}"
