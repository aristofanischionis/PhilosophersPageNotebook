  "** But I hope that by the decision and authority of wise princes that sometime devout and learned men from the churches of other nations and of ours may be summoned together to deliberate about all the controversies and that there be handed down to posterity one harmonious, true, and clear form of doctrine, without any ambiguity. Meanwhile, as far as possible, let us encourage the union of our churches with measured advice.",
  "**I have received blows from him.",
  "*It does not make such a difference whether you are simply mute or employ no art for speaking. For it is not feasible that you can express what you think as it should be understood unless you acquire and strengthen the ability to speak by art.",
  "* How miserable is the condition of men when the better a thing is, the further it recedes from our sight and the less it is recognized.",
  "* No one will be able to speak suitably and clearly about anything unless he has shaped his speech by some art, by imitation of the best.",
  "* Does the painter imitate the body correctly if he guides his brush without any method, and if his hand is moved at random and the lines are not drawn with art? In the same way you will not put the sentiment of your mind in front of the others\u2019 eyes unless you use appropriate and distinct words, a fitting arrangement of words and the right order of sentences. For, just as we represent bodies by colours, we represent the sentiment of our mind by speech.",
  "* You can see for what reason I commend the study of eloquence to you\u2014because we can neither explain what we ourselves want, nor understand the surviving writing written by our ancestors, unless we have thoroughly studied a fixed rule for speaking. For my part, I do not see how there could be others who wish neither to explain what they think, nor to understand what is excellently said.",
  "* The shadow does not follow the body more closely than eloquence accompanies sagacity.",
  "* Sagacity and eloquence are linked together to such an extent that they cannot be torn asunder for any reason.",
  "* What do you believe was on the mind of the ancient Romans that they called the arts of speaking humanity? They judged that, indisputably, by the study of these disciplines not only was the tongue refined, but also the wildness and barbarity of people\u2019s minds was amended."
