  "* Liberty is the power that we have over ourselves. ",
  "* Even God cannot make two times two not make four.",
  "* Not to know certain things is a great part of wisdom.",
  "* So is there no kind of life more wicked than that of mercenary Souldiers, who without any respect had to the equity of the Cause, fight only for plunder and pay."
