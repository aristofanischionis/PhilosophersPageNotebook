  "** The living force of his soul gained the day: on he passed far beyond the flaming walls of the world and traversed throughout in mind and spirit the immeasurable universe.",
  "** Superstition is now in her turn cast down and trampled underfoot, whilst we by the victory are exalted high as heaven.",

  "** And yet it is hard to believe that anythingin nature could stand revealed as solid matter.The lightning of heaven goes through the walls of houses,like shouts and speech; iron glows white in fire;red-hot rocks are shattered by savage steam;hard gold is softened and melted down by heat;chilly brass, defeated by heat, turns liquid;heat seeps through silver, so does piercing cold;by custom raising the cup, we feel them bothas water is poured in, drop by drop, above.",
  "* Ita res accendent lumina rebus.",
  "** Pleasant it is, when over a great sea the winds trouble the waters, to gaze from shore upon anothers great tribulation: not because any mans troubles are a delectable joy, but because to perceive from what ills you are free yourself is pleasant.",
  "** But there is nothing sweeter than to dwell in towers that riseOn high, serene and fortified with teachings of the wise,From which you may peer down upon the others as they strayThis way and that, seeking the path of life, losing their way:The skirmishing of wits, the scramble for renown, the fight,Each striving harder than the next, and struggling day and night,To climb atop a heap of riches and lay claim to might.",
  "** O pitiable minds of men, O blind intelligences! In what gloom of life, in how great perils is passed all your poor span of time! not to see that all nature barks for is this, that pain be removed away out of the body, and that the mind, kept away from care and fear, enjoy a feeling of delight!",
  "** Life is one long struggle in the dark.",
  "** For as children tremble and fear everything in the blind darkness, so we in the light sometimes fear what is no more to be feared than the things that children in the dark hold in terror and imagine will come true. This terror, therefore, and darkness of mind must be dispelled not by the rays of the sun and glittering shafts of daylight, but by the aspect and law of nature.",
  "** Thus the sum of things is ever being renewed, and mortal creatures live dependent one upon another. Some species increase, others diminish, and in a short space the generations of living creatures are changed and, like runners, pass on the torch of life.",

  "** If you well apprehend and keep in mind these things, nature free at once and rid of her haughty lords is seen to do all things spontaneously of herself without the meddling of the gods.",
  "** For no fact is so simple we believe it at first sight,And there is nothing that exists so great or marvellousThat over time mankind does not admire it less and less.",
  "** Cease therefore to be dismayed by the mere novelty and so to reject reason from your mind with loathing: weigh the questions rather with keen judgment and if they seem to you to be true, surrender, or if the thing is false, gird yourself to the encounter.",
  "** So it is more useful to watch a man in times of peril, and in adversity to discern what kind of man he is; for then at last words of truth are drawn from the depths of his heart, and the mask is torn off, reality remains.",
  "** Besides we feel that mind to being comesAlong with body, with body grows and ages.For just as children totter round aboutWith frames infirm and tender, so there followsA weakling wisdom in their minds; and then,Where years have ripened into robust powers,Counsel is also greater, more increasedThe power of mind; thereafter, where alreadyThe bodys shattered by master-powers of eld,And fallen the frame with its enfeebled powers,Thought hobbles, tongue wanders, and the mind gives way;All fails, alls lacking at the selfsame time.Therefore it suits that even the souls dissolved,Like smoke, into the lofty winds of air;Since we behold the same to being comeAlong with body and grow, and, as Ive taught,Crumble and crack, therewith outworn by eld.",
  "** Therefore death is nothing to us, it matters not one jot, since the nature of the mind is understood to be mortal.",
  "** Nay, even suppose when we have suffered fate,The soul could feel in her divided state,Whats that to us? for we are only we,While souls and bodies in one frame agree.Nay, though our atoms should revolve by chance,And matter leap into the former dance;Though time our life and motion could restore,And make our bodies what they were before,What gain to us would all this bustle bring?The new-made man would be another thing;When once an interrupting pause is made,That individual being is decayed.We, who are dead and gone, shall bear no partIn all the pleasures, nor shall feel the smart,Which to that other mortal shall accrue,Whom of our matter, time shall mould anew.For backward if you look, on that long spaceOf ages past, and view the changing faceOf matter, tossed and variously combinedIn sundry shapes, \u2019tis easy for the mindFrom thence t infer that seeds of things have beenIn the same order as they now are seen:Which yet our dark remembrance cannot trace,Because a pause of life, a gaping spaceHas come betwixt, where memory lies dead,And all the wandering motions from the sense are fled.",

  "** To none is life given in freehold; to all on lease.",

  "** To avoid falling into the toils of love is not so hard as, after you are caught, to get out of the nets you are in and to break through the strong meshes of Venus.",
  "** Custom renders love attractive; for that which is struck by oft-repeated blows however lightly, yet after long course of time is overpowered and gives way. See you not too that drops of water falling on rocks after long course of time scoop a hole through these rocks?",
  "** For every one feels to what purpose he can use his own powers. Before the horns of a calf appear and sprout from his forehead, he butts with them when angry, and pushes passionately.",
