  "* Whatever may be the discoveries of the scientific mind, none can dispute the eternal truths propounded by the Upanishads. Though they may appear as riddles, the key to solving them lies in our heart and if one were to approach them with an open mind one could secure the treasure as did the Rishis of ancient times. ",
  "* The Upanishads have tackled every fundamental problem of life. They have given us an intimate account of reality.\" ....\"On the tree of wisdom there is no fairer flower than the Upanishads, and no finer fruit than the Vedanta philosophy,... The system of Vedanta, as founded on the Upanishads and Vedanta Sutras and accompanied by Shankaras commentary on them---equal in rank to Plato and Kant---is one of the most valuable products of the genius of mankind in his researches of the eternal truth.
