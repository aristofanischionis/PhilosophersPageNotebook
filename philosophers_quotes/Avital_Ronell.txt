  "* For Luther judgment was a real problem, because everyone gets off on judgment, according to Luther. In fact you have to put a restraining order, a gag order, on those, and thats everyone, who want to judge everyone and everything at top speed. So that when you have a rush to judgment, ... its also the rush of judgment. ... Id like us to consider the libidinal investment that Luther sees in judgment and legislates against.",
  "* According to Luther everyone judges everyone. This is because theres an intense desire to be judging. Then those of us on the masochistic side of things want to be judged. Thus we publish. We teach. We learn. We beg to be judged and decimated."
