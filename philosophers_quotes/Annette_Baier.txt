  "* One ground for suspicion of apparently sincere moral convictions is their link with some special interest of those who hold them. The questions cui bono and cui malo are appropriate questions to raise when we are searching for possible contaminants of conscience. Entrenched privilege, and fear of losing it, distorts ones moral sense.",
  "* experimenters on animals would, unless compensated, all have to suffer significant personal loss if we were to change our practices. They cannot therefore be expected to see the moral issue without the distortion of special interest. The scientists might claim that in their case their own interest coincides with a universal human interest, but I think the butcher and the furrier could make a similar claim[.]",
  "* I think there is at least one moral theory of respectable lineage and good independent credentials that can accommodate such fairly minimal intuitions about us and animals. This is the theory Hume offers us. I do not consider Hume a forerunner of Mill, to be offering us a theory about human virtues, not a theory about utility maximization and the duties that might involve.",
  "* experimenters their protests.",
  "* Hume describes (E, 235) as a \u201cfancied monster\u201d a man who has \u201cno manner of concern to his fellow-creatures but to regard the happiness and misery of all sensible beings with greater indifference than even two contiguous shades of the same color\u201d (ibid.). To limit ones concern to those sensible beings who are of ones own species is to be part-monster, but such monsters, alas, are not merely fancied ones."
