  "* If the sociologist has a role, it is probably more to furnish weapons than to give lessons.",
  "* By making social hierarchies and the reproduction of these hierarchies appear based upon the hierarchy of \u2018gifts\u2019, merits, or skill established and ratified by its sanctions, or, in a word, by converting social hierarchies into academic hierarchies, the educational system fulfils a function of legitimation which is more and more necessary to the perpetuation of the \u2018social order\u2019 as the evolution of the power relationship between classes tends more completely to exclude the imposition of a hierarchy based upon the crude and ruthless affirmation of the power relationship.",

And what is most important in relation to that cognitive map is not what is overtly stated and discussed \u2013 but what is left unstated, or ignored."
