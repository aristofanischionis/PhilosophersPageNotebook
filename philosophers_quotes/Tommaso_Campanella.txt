  "*If You return to earth, come armed Lord,because enemies are preparing other crosses\u2014not Turks, not Jews\u2014but those of Your own kingdom",
  "*The world is the book where the eternal Wisdom wrote its own concepts",
  "*I learn more from the anatomy of an ant or a blade of grass...than from all the books which have been written since the beginning of time.  This is so, since I have begun...to read the book of God...the model according to which I correct the human books which have been copied badly and arbitrarily and without attention to the things that are written in the original book of the Universe."
