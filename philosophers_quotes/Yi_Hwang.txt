  "** How do the green mountains through the ages remain green? How do the flowing waters day and night keep flowing? Let us not cease either but through the ages remain green.",
  "** Even ignorant men seek perfection; perhaps the way is easy.Not even wise men can be perfect; perhaps the way is difficult.  Easy or difficult, between the two, I do not feel the advance of age.",
  "* ...[T]he Confucian way of learning is that in order to ascend to lofty heights one must begin with the lowly, to travel afar one must begin with what is near. Indeed, to begin from the lowly and near certainly is a slow process. But apart from it, whence comes the lofty and distant? In applying one\u2019s efforts to gradual advancement one attain what is lofty and distant without parting from what is lowly and near; it is in this that it is different from Buddhist and Daoist learning."
