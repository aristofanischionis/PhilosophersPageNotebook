  "* You must learn all things, both the unshaken heart of persuasive truth, and the opinions of mortals in which there is no true warranty.",
  "* The only roads of enquiry there are to think of: one, that it is and that it is not possible for it not to be, this is the path of persuasion (for truth is its companion); the other, that it is not and that it must not be \u2014 this I say to you is a path wholly unknowable.",
  "* For it is the same thing that can be thought and that can be.",
  "* It is indifferent to me where I am to begin, for there shall I return again.",
  "* Never will this prevail, that the things that are not are \u2014 bar your thought from this road of inquiry.",
  "* Do not let habit, born from experience, force you along this road, directing aimless eye and echoing ear and tongue; but judge by reason the much contested proof which I have spoken.",
  "* There is one story left, one road: that it is. And on this road there are very many signs that, being, is uncreated and imperishable, whole, unique, unwavering, and complete."
