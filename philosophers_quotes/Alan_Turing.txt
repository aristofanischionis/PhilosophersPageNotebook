  "* Mathematical reasoning may be regarded rather schematically as the exercise of a combination of two facilities, which we may call intuition and ingenuity. The activity of the intuition consists in making spontaneous judgements which are not the result of conscious trains of reasoning... The exercise of ingenuity in mathematics consists in aiding the intuition through suitable arrangements of propositions, and perhaps geometrical figures or drawings.",
  "* Instruction tables will have to be made up by mathematicians with computing experience and perhaps a certain puzzle-solving ability. There need be no real danger of it ever becoming a drudge, for any processes that are quite mechanical may be turned over to the machine itself.",
  "* A man provided with paper, pencil, and rubber, and subject to strict discipline, is in effect a universal machine.",
  "* There is a remarkably close parallel between the problems of the physicist and those of the cryptographer. The system on which a message is enciphered corresponds to the laws of the universe, the intercepted messages to the evidence available, the keys for a day or a message to important constants which have to be determined. The correspondence is very close, but the subject matter of cryptography is very easily dealt with by discrete machinery, physics not so easily.",
  "* This is only a foretaste of what is to come, and only the shadow of what is going to be. We have to have some experience with the machine before we really know its capabilities. It may take years before we settle down to the new possibilities, but I do not see why it should not enter any one of the fields normally covered by the human intellect, and eventually compete on equal terms.",
  "* Science is a differential equation. Religion is a boundary condition.",
  "* The Exclusion Principle is laid down purely for the benefit of the electrons themselves, who might be corrupted (and become dragons or demons) if allowed to associate too freely.",
  "* The \"computable\" numbers may be described briefly as the real numbers whose expressions as a decimal are calculable by finite means. ...According to my definition, a number is computable if its decimal can be written down by a machine. ...I show that certain large classes of numbers are computable. They include, for instance, the real parts of all {{w|algebraic number}}s, the real parts of the zeros of the \u03c0, e, etc. The computable numbers do not, however, include all definable numbers. ...[C]onclusions are reached which are superficially similar to those of G\u00f6del. ...[I]t is shown ...that the Hilbertian {{w|Entscheidungsproblem}} can have no solution. In a recent paper {{w|Alonzo Church}}...  reaches similar conclusions...",
  "* We may compare a man in the process of computing a real number to a machine which is only capable of a finite number of conditions q1, q2, ..., qK which will be called \" m-configurations \".",
  "* The machine is supplied with a \"tape\" (the analogue of paper) running through it, and divided into sections (called \"squares\") each capable of bearing a \"symbol\".",
  "* The \"scanned symbol\" is the only one of which the machine is... \"directly aware\". However, by altering its m-configuration the machine can effectively remember some of the symbols which it has \"seen\" (scanned) previously.",
  "* In some of the configurations in which the scanned square is blank... the machine writes down a new symbol on the scanned square: in other configurations it erases the scanned symbol.",
  "* The machine may also change the square which is being scanned, but only by shifting it one place to right or left.",
  "* [T]he m-configuration may be changed.",
  "* Some of the symbols written down will form the sequence of figures which is the decimal of the real number... being computed. The others are just rough notes to \"assist the memory \". ...[O]nly ...these rough notes ...will be liable to erasure.",
  "* [T]hese operations include all those which are used in the computation...",
  "* For some purposes we might use machines (choice... or c-machines) whose motion is only partially determined by the configuration... When such a machine reaches... ambiguous configurations, it cannot go on until some arbitrary choice has been made by an external operator. This would be the case if we were using machines to deal with axiomatic systems.",
  "* In this paper I deal only with automatic machines, and will therefore often omit the prefix \u0251-.",
  "* It will be useful to put... tables into a... standard form. ...The lines of the table are... of formm-config. | Symbol | Operations | Final m-config. In this way we obtain a complete description of the machine. ...This new description of the machine may be called the standard description (S.D). ...[W]e shall have  a description of the machine in the form of an arabic numeral. The integer represented by this numeral may be called a description number (D.N) of the machine. The D.N determine the S.D and the structure of the machine uniquely. The machine whose D.N is n may be described as \\mathcal{M}(n).",
  "* To each computable sequence there corresponds at least one description number, while to no description number does there correspond more than one computable sequence. The computable sequences and numbers are therefore enumerable.",
  "* It is possible to invent a single machine which can be used to compute any computable sequence. If this machine \\mathcal{U} is supplied with a tape on the beginning of which is written the S.D of some computing  machine \\mathcal{M}, then \\mathcal{U} will compute  the  same  sequence  as \\mathcal{M}.",
  "* \"Can machines think?\"... The new form of the problem can be described in terms of a game which we call the imitation game.\" It is played with three people, a man (A), a woman (B), and an interrogator (C) who may be of either sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart from the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by labels X and Y, and at the end of the game he says either \"X is A and Y is B\" or \"X is B and Y is A.\" The interrogator is allowed to put questions to A and B... We now ask the question, \"What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game?\" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace our original, \"Can machines think?\"",
  "* We do not wish to penalise the machine for its inability to shine in beauty competitions, nor to penalise a man for losing in a race against an aeroplane. The conditions of our game make these disabilities irrelevant.",
  "* May not machines carry out something which ought to be described as thinking but which is very different from what a man does?",
  "* We are not asking whether all digital computers would do well in the game nor whether the computers at present available would do well, but whether there are imaginable computers which would do well.",
  "* The idea behind digital computers may be explained by saying that these machines are intended to carry out any operations which could be done by a human computer.",
  "* A digital computer can usually be regarded as consisting of three parts: (i) Store. (ii) Executive unit. (iii) Control. ...The executive unit is the part which carries out the various individual operations involved in a calculation. ...It is the duty of the control to see that...[the table of] instructions are obeyed correctly and in the right order. ...A typical instruction might say\u2014\"Add the number stored in position 6809 to that in 4302 and put the result back into the latter storage position.\" Needless to say it would not occur in the machine expressed in English. It would more likely be coded in a form such as 6809430217. Here 17 says which of various possible operations [add] is to be performed on the two numbers. ...It will be noticed that the instruction takes up 10 digits and so forms one packet of information...",
  "* Suppose Mother wants Tommy to call at the cobblers every morning on his way to school to see if her shoes are done, she can ask him afresh every morning. Alternatively she can stick up a notice once and for all in the hall which he will see when he leaves for school and which tells him to call for the shoes, and also to destroy the notice when he comes back if he has the shoes with him.",
  "*  If one wants to make a machine mimic the behaviour of the human computer in some complex operation one has to ask him how it is done, and then translate the answer into the form of an instruction table. Constructing instruction tables is usually described as \"programming.\"",
  "* I believe that at the end of the century the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted.",
  "* I am not very impressed with theological arguments whatever they may be used to support. Such arguments have often been found unsatisfactory in the past.  In the time of Galileo it was argued that the texts, \"And the sun stood still... and hasted not to go down about a whole day\" (Joshua x. 13) and \"He laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not move at any time\" (Psalm cv. 5) were an adequate refutation of the Copernican theory.",
  "* Machines take me by surprise with great frequency.",
  "* The view that machines cannot give rise to surprises is due, I believe, to a fallacy to which philosophers and mathematicians are particularly subject. This is the assumption that as soon as a fact is presented to a mind all consequences of that fact spring into the mind simultaneously with it. It is a very useful assumption under many circumstances, but one too easily forgets that it is false. A natural consequence of doing so is that one then assumes that there is no virtue in the mere working out of consequences from data and general principles.",
  "* Another simile would be an atomic pile of less than critical size: an injected idea is to correspond to a neutron entering the pile from without. Each such neutron will cause a certain disturbance which eventually dies away. If, however, the size of the pile is sufficiently increased, the disturbance caused by such an incoming neutron will very likely go on and on increasing until the whole pile is destroyed. Is there a corresponding phenomenon for minds, and is there one for machines? There does seem to be one for the human mind. The majority of them seem to be \"sub-critical,\" i.e., to correspond in this analogy to piles of sub-critical size. An idea presented to such a mind will on average give rise to less than one idea in reply. A smallish proportion are super-critical. An idea presented to such a mind may give rise to a whole \"theory\" consisting of secondary, tertiary and more remote ideas. Animals minds seem to be very definitely sub-critical. Adhering to this analogy we ask, \"Can a machine be made to be super-critical?\"",
  "* Presumably the child-brain is something like a note-book as one buys it from the stationers. Rather little mechanism, and lots of blank sheets.",
  "* We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done.",
  "* It is customary... to offer a grain of comfort, in the form of a statement that some peculiarly human characteristic could never be imitated by a machine. ... I cannot offer any such comfort, for I believe that no such bounds can be set."
