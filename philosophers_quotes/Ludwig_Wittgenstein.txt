  "* It seems to me as good as certain that we cannot get the upper hand against England. The English \u2014 the best race in the world \u2014 cannot lose! We, however, can lose and shall lose, if not this year then next year. The thought that our race is going to be beaten depresses me terribly, because I am completely German.",

  "* You wont \u2014 I really believe \u2014 get too much out of reading it. Because you wont understand it; the content will seem strange to you. In reality, it isnt strange to you, for the point is ethical. I once wanted to give a few words in the foreword which now actually are not in it, which, however, Ill write to you now because they might be a key for you: I wanted to write that my work consists of two parts: of the one which is here, and of everything which I have not written. And precisely this second part is the important one.",
  "* \"It is necessary to be given the prop that all elementary props are given.\" This is not necessary because it is even impossible. There is no such prop! That all elementary props are given is SHOWN by there being none having an elementary sense which is not given.",

  "* Logic takes care of itself; all we have to do is to look and see how it does it.",
  "* Dont get involved in partial problems, but always take flight to where there is a free view over the whole single great problem, even if this view is still not a clear one.",
  "* My difficulty is only an \u2014 enormous \u2014 difficulty of expression.",
  "* I cannot get from the nature of the proposition to the individual logical operations!!!  That is, I cannot bring out how far the proposition is the picture of the situation. I am almost inclined to give up all my efforts. \u2014\u2014",
  "* It is one of the chief skills of the philosopher not to occupy himself with questions which do not concern him.",
  "* Language is a part of our organism and no less complicated than it.",
  "* One of the most difficult of the philosophers tasks is to find out where the shoe pinches.",
  "* Certainly it is correct to say: Conscience is the voice of God.",
  "* What do I know about God and the purpose of life?  I know that this world exists.  That I am placed in it like my eye in its visual field.  That something about it is problematic, which we call its meaning.  This meaning does not lie in it but outside of it.  That life is the world.  That my will penetrates the world.  That my will is good or evil.  Therefore that good and evil are somehow connected with the meaning of the world.  The meaning of life, i.e. the meaning of the world, we can call God.  And connect with this the comparison of God to a father.  To pray is to think about the meaning of life.",
  "* To believe in a God means to understand the question about the meaning of life.  To believe in a God means to see that the facts of the world are not the end of the matter.  To believe in God means to see that life has a meaning.",
  "* There are two godheads: the world and my independent I.  I am either happy or unhappy, that is all. It can be said: good or evil do not exist.  A man who is happy must have no fear. Not even in the face of death.  Only a man who lives not in time but in the present is happy.",
  "* The World and Life are one. Physiological life is of course not \"Life\". And neither is psychological life. Life is the world.  Ethics does not treat of the world. Ethics must be a condition of the world, like logic.  Ethics and Aesthetics are one.",
  "* It is true: Man is the microcosm:  I am my world.",
  "** Journal entry (12 October 1916), p. 84e",
  "* It is clear that the causal nexus is not a nexus at all.",
  "* The aim of the book is to set a limit to thought, or rather \u2014 not to thought, but to the expression of thoughts: for in order to be able to set a limit to thought, we should have to find both sides of the limit thinkable (i.e. we should have to be able to think what cannot be thought).  It will therefore only be in language that the limit can be set, and what lies on the other side of the limit will simply be nonsense.",
  "* The whole sense of the book might be summed up the following words: what can be said at all can be said clearly, and what we cannot talk about we must pass over in silence.",
  "* The world is all that is the case. (1)",
  "* The world is the totality of facts, not things. (1.1)",
  "* What is the case, the fact, is the existence of atomic facts. (2)",
  "* The logical picture of the facts is the thought. (3)",
  "* Though a state of affairs that would contravene the laws of physics can be represented by us spatially, one that would contravene the laws of geometry cannot. (3.0321)",
  "* The thought is the significant proposition. (4)",
  "* Philosophy aims at the logical clarification of thoughts. Philosophy is not a body of doctrine but an activity. A philosophical work consists essentially of elucidations. Philosophy does not result in philosophical propositions, but rather in the clarification of propositions. Without philosophy thoughts are, as it were, cloudy and indistinct: its task is to make them clear and to give them sharp boundaries. (4.112)",
  "* It is quite impossible for a proposition to state that it itself is true. (4.442)",
  "* A tautologys truth is certain, a propositions possible, a contradictions impossible. (Certain, possible, impossible: here we have the first indication of the scale that we need in the theory of probability.) (4.464)",
  "* Propositions are truth-functions of elementary propositions. (An elementary proposition is a truth-function of itself.) (5)",
  "* If I cannot say a priori what elementary propositions there are, then the attempt to do so must lead to obvious nonsense. (5.5571)",
  "* The limits of my language mean the limits of my world. (5.6)",
  "* Logic pervades the world: the limits of the world are also its limits. So we cannot say in logic, \"The world has this in it, and this, but not that.\" For that would appear to presuppose that we were excluding certain possibilities, and this cannot be the case, since it would require that logic should go beyond the limits of the world; for only in that way could it view those limits from the other side as well. We cannot think what we cannot think; so what we cannot think we cannot say either. (5.61)",
  "* This remark provides the key to the problem, how much truth there is in solipsism. For what the solipsist means is quite correct; only it cannot be said, but makes itself manifest. The world is my world: this is manifest in the fact that the limits of language (of that language which alone I understand) mean the limits of my world. (5.62)",
  "* The world and life are one. (5.621)",
  "** Original German: Ich bin meine welt (Der Mikrokosmos.)",
  "* The subject does not belong to the world, but it is a limit of the world. (5.632)",
  "* The world of the happy is quite different from the world of the unhappy. (6.43)",
  "* Death is not an event in life: we do not live to experience death. If we take eternity to mean not infinite temporal duration but timelessness, then eternal life belongs to those who live in the present. Our life has no end in just the way in which our visual field has no limits. (6.4311)",
  "** Variant translation: The mystical is not how the world is, but that it is.",
  "* Scepticism is not irrefutable, but obviously nonsensical, when it tries to raise doubts where no questions can be asked.  For doubt can exist only where a question exists, a question only where an answer exists, and an answer only where something can be said. (6.51)",
  "* There are, indeed, things that cannot be put into words. They make themselves manifest. They are what is mystical. (6.522)",
  "* My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them. (He must so to speak throw away the ladder, after he has climbed up on it.) (6.54)",
  "** Translated: Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent. (7)",
  "* A proposition is completely logically analyzed if its grammar is made completely clear: no matter what idiom it may be written or expressed in...",
  "* What I give is the morphology of the use of an expression. I show that it has kinds of uses of which you had not dreamed. In philosophy one feels forced to look at a concept in a certain way. What I do is suggest, or even invent, other ways of looking at it. I suggest possibilities of which you had not previously thought. You thought that there was one possibility, or only two at most. But I made you think of others. Furthermore, I made you see that it was absurd to expect the concept to conform to those narrow possibilities. Thus your mental cramp is relieved, and you are free to look around the field of use of the expression and to describe the different kinds of uses of it.",
  "* Tell them Ive had a wonderful life.",
  "* The idea that in order to get clear about the meaning of a general term one had to find the common element in all its applications has shackled philosophical investigation; for it has not only led to no result, but also made the philosopher dismiss as irrelevant the concrete cases, which alone could have helped him understand the usage of the general term.",
  "* For remember that in general we dont use language according to strict rules \u2014 it hasnt been taught us by means of strict rules, either.",
  "* What should we gain by a definition, as it can only lead us to other undefined terms?",
  "* But ordinary language is all right.",
  "* The difficulty in philosophy is to say no more than we know.",
  "* To convince someone of the truth, it is not enough to state it, but rather one must find the path from error to truth.",
  "* I must plunge into the water of doubt again and again.",
  "* Frazers account of the magical and religious views of mankind is unsatisfactory; it makes these views look like errors.",
  "* Every explanation is after all an hypothesis.",
  "* A religious symbol does not rest on any opinion. And error belongs only with opinion. One would like to say: This is what took place here; laugh, if you can.",
  "* Burning in effigy. Kissing the picture of ones beloved... it aims at nothing at all; we just behave this way and then we feel satisfied.",
  "* The ceremonial (hot or cold) as opposed to the haphazard (lukewarm) characterizes piety.",
  "* We must plow through the whole of language.",
  "* Frazer is much more savage than most of his savages, for they are not as far removed from the understanding of spiritual matter as a twentieth-century Englishman. His explanations of primitive practices are much cruder than the meaning of these practices themselves.",
  "* When I am furious about something, I sometimes beat the ground or a tree with my walking stick. But I certainly do not believe that the ground is to blame or that my beating can help anything... And all rites are of this kind.",
  "* An entire mythology is stored within our language.",
  "* What makes a subject difficult to understand \u2014 if it is significant, important \u2014 is not that some special instruction about abstruse things is necessary to understand it. Rather it is the contrast between the understanding of the subject and what most people want to see. Because of this the very things that are most obvious can become the most difficult to understand. What has to be overcome is not difficulty of the intellect but of the will. [Nicht eine Schwierigkeit des Verstandes, sondern des Willens ist zu \u00fcberwinden.]",
  "** Philosophizing is: rejecting false arguments.  The philosopher strives to find the liberating word, that is, the word that finally permits us to grasp what up to now has intangibly weighed down upon our consciousness.",
  "* The problems are dissolved in the actual sense of the word \u2014 like a lump of sugar in water.",
  "*Philosophical problems can be compared to locks on safes, which can be opened by dialing a certain word or number, so that no force can open the door until just this word has been hit upon, and once it is hit upon any child can open it.",
  "* Philosophy unravels the knots in our thinking; hence its results must be simple, but its activity is as complicated as the knots that it unravels.",
  "* People are deeply imbedded in philosophical, i.e., grammatical confusions. And to free them presupposes pulling them out of the immensely manifold connections they are caught up in.",
  "* The aim of philosophy is to erect a wall at the point where language stops anyway.",
  "* Philosophers are often like little children, who first scribble random lines on a piece of paper with their pencils, and now ask an adult \"What is that?\"",
  "* We are asleep. Our Life is a dream. But we wake up sometimes, just enough to know that we are dreaming.",
  "* What is troubling us is the tendency to believe that the mind is like a little man within.",
  "* Bach wrote on the title page of his Orgelb\u00fcchlein: \"To the glory of the most high God, and that my neighbour may be benefited thereby.\" That is what I would have liked to say about my work.",
  "* Make sure that your religion is a matter between you and God only.",
  "* The meaning of a question is the method of answering it: then what is the meaning of Do two men really mean the same by the word \"white\"? Tell me how you are searching, and I will tell you what you are searching for.",
  "* Why in the world shouldnt they have regarded with awe and reverence that act by which the human race is perpetuated. Not every religion has to have St. Augustines attitude to sex. Why even in our culture marriages are celebrated in a church, everyone present knows what is going to happen that night, but that doesnt prevent it being a religious ceremony.",
  "* A serious and good philosophical work could be written consisting entirely of jokes.",
  "* I dont know why we are here, but Im pretty sure that it is not in order to enjoy ourselves.",
  "* Kierkegaard was by far the most profound thinker of the last century. Kierkegaard was a saint.",
  "* A good guide will take you through the more important streets more often than he takes you down side streets; a bad guide will do the opposite. In philosophy Im a rather bad guide.",
  "* Uttering a word is like striking a note on the keyboard of the imagination.",
  "* For a large class of cases \u2014 though not for all \u2014 in which we employ the word meaning it can be explained thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language.",
  "* Dont say: \u201cThey must have something in common, or they would not be called \u2018games\u2019\" but look and see whether there is anything common to all. For if you look at them, you wont see something that is common to all, but similarities, affinities, and a whole series of them at that. To repeat: dont think, but look!",
  "** Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of our language.",
  "* Like everything metaphysical the harmony between thought and reality is to be found in the grammar of the language.",
  "* What we do is to bring words back from their metaphysical to their everyday use.",
  "* What we are destroying is nothing but houses of cards and we are clearing up the ground of language on which they stood.",
  "* Your questions refer to words; so I have to talk about words.  You say: The point isnt the word, but its meaning, and you think of the meaning as a thing of the same kind as the word, though also different from the word. Here the word, there the meaning.",
  "* Philosophy may in no way interfere with the actual use of language; it can in the end only describe it.",
  "* The aspects of things that are most important for us are hidden because of their simplicity and familiarity. (One is unable to notice something \u2014 because it is always before ones eyes.) The real foundations of his enquiry do not strike a man at all. Unless that fact has at some time struck him. \u2014 And this means: we fail to be struck by what, once seen, is most striking and most powerful.",
  "* The real discovery is the one which enables me to stop doing philosophy when I want to. The one that gives philosophy peace, so that it is no longer tormented by questions which bring itself into question.",
  "* To obey a rule, to make a report, to give an order, to play a game of chess, are customs (uses, institutions)",
  "* If I have exhausted the justifications, I have reached bedrock and my spade is turned. Then I am inclined to say: \"This is simply what I do.\"",
  "* When I obey a rule, I do not choose.  I obey the rule blindly.",
  "* So in the end when one is doing philosophy one gets to the point where one would like just to emit an inarticulate sound.",
  "* \"Everything is already there in....\" How does it come about that [an] arrow points? Doesnt it seem to carry in it something besides itself? \u2014 \"No, not the dead line on paper; only the psychical thing, the meaning, can do that.\" \u2014 That is both true and false. The arrow points only in the application that a living being makes of it.",
  "* My aim is: to teach you to pass from a piece of disguised nonsense to something that is patent nonsense.",
  "* But if you say: \"How am I to know what he means, when I see nothing but the signs he gives?\" then I say: \"How is he to know what he means, when he has nothing but the signs either?\"",
  "* Does man think because he has found that thinking pays?  Does he bring his children up because he has found it pays?",
  "* So we do sometimes think because it has been found to pay.",
  "* One can mistrust ones own senses, but not ones own belief.  If there were a verb meaning \"to believe falsely,\" it would not have any significant first person, present indicative.",
  "* The human body is the best picture of the human soul.",

  "* 1. If you do know that here is one hand, well grant you all the rest.",
  "* 94. I did not get my picture of the world by satisfying myself of its correctness; nor do I have it because I am satisfied of its correctness. No: it is the inherited background against which I distinguish between true and false.",
  "* 105. All testing, all confirmation and disconfirmation of a hypothesis takes place already within a system. And this system is not a more or less arbitrary and doubtful point of departure for all our arguments; no it belongs to the essence of what we call an argument. The system is not so much the point of departure, as the element in which our arguments have their life.",
  "* 115. If you tried to doubt everything you would not get as far as doubting anything. The game of doubting itself presupposes {{w|certainty}}.",
  "* 144. The child learns to believe a host of things. I.e. it learns to act according to these beliefs. Bit by bit there forms a system of what is believed, and in that system some things stand unshakeably fast and some are more or less liable to shift. What stands fast does so, not because it is intrinsically obvious or convincing; it is rather held fast by what lies around it.",
  "* 205. If the true is what is grounded, then the ground is not true, nor yet false.",
  "* 206. If someone asked us but is that true? we might say \"yes\" to him; and if he demanded grounds we might say \"I cant give you any grounds, but if you learn more you too will think the same.\"",

  "* 310. A pupil and a teacher. The pupil will not let anything be explained to him, for he continually interrupts with doubts, for instance as to the existence of things, the meaning for words, etc. The teacher says \"Stop interrupting me and do as I tell you. So far your doubts dont make sense at all.\"",
  "* 370. But more correctly: The fact that I use the word \"hand\" and all the other words in my sentence without a second thought, indeed that I should stand before the abyss if I wanted so much as to try doubting their meanings \u2014 shows that absence of doubt belongs to the essence of the language-game, that the question \"How do I know...\" drags out the language-game, or else does away with it.",
  "* 378. Knowledge is in the end based on acknowledgement.",
  "* 387. [I believe it might interest a philosopher, one who can think himself, to read my notes. For even if I have hit the mark only rarely, he would recognize what targets I had been ceaselessly aiming at.]",
  "* 467. I am sitting with a philosopher in the garden; he says again and again \"I know that thats a tree\", pointing to a tree that is near us. Someone else arrives and hears this, and I tell them: \"This fellow isnt insane. We are only doing philosophy.\" ",

  "* Reading the Socratic dialogues one has the feeling: what a frightful waste of time! Whats the point of these arguments that prove nothing and clarify nothing?",
  "* You always hear people say that philosophy makes no progress and that the same philosophical problems which were already preoccupying the Greeks are still troubling us today. But people who say that do not understand the reason why it has to be so. The reason is that our language has remained the same and always introduces us to the same questions. ... I read: \"philosophers are no nearer to the meaning of Reality than Plato got,...\". What a strange situation. How extraordinary that Plato could have got even as far as he did! Or that we could not get any further! Was it because Plato was so extremely clever?",
  "* Philosophers often behave like little children who scribble some marks on a piece of paper at random and then ask the grown-up \"Whats that?\" \u2014 It happened like this: the grown-up had drawn pictures for the child several times and said \"this is a man,\" \"this is a house,\" etc. And then the child makes some marks too and asks: whats this then?",

  "* If you use a trick in logic, whom can you be tricking other than yourself?",

  "* The truth can be spoken only by someone who is already at home in it; not by someone who still lives in untruthfulness, and does no more than reach out towards it from within untruthfulness.",
  "* A man will be imprisoned in a room with a door thats unlocked and opens inwards; as long as it does not occur to him to pull rather than push it.",
  "* A teacher who can show good, or indeed astounding results while he is teaching, is still not on that account a good teacher, for it may be that, while his pupils are under his immediate influence, he raises them to a level which is not natural to them, without developing their own capacities for work at this level, so that they immediately decline again once the teacher leaves the schoolroom.",
  "* Courage, not cleverness; not even inspiration, is the grain of mustard that grows up to be a great tree.",

  "* The purely corporeal can be uncanny. Compare the way angels and devils are portrayed. So-called \"miracles\" must be connected with this. A miracle must be, as it were, a sacred gesture.",
  "* The way you use the word \"God\" does not show whom you mean \u2014 but, rather, what you mean.",
  "* A hero looks death in the face, real death, not just the image of death. Behaving honourably in a crisis doesnt mean being able to act the part of a hero well, as in the theatre, it means being able to look death itself in the eye.  For an actor may play lots of different roles, but at the end of it all he himself, the human being, is the one who has to die.",
