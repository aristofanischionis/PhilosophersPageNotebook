  "* They that examine into the Nature of Man, abstract from Art and Education, may observe, that what renders him a Sociable Animal, consists not in his desire of Company, Good-nature, Pity, Affability, and other Graces of a fair Outside; but that his vilest and most hateful Qualities are the most necessary Accomplishments to fit him for the largest, and, according to the World, the happiest and most flourishing Societies.",
  "* If laying aside all worldly Greatness and Vain-Glory, I should be askd where I thought it was most probable that Men might enjoy true Happiness, I would prefer a small peaceable Society, in which Men, neither envyd nor esteemd by Neighbours, should be contented to live upon the Natural Product of the Spot they inhabit, to a vast Multitude abounding in Wealth and Power, that should always be conquering others by their Arms Abroad, and debauching themselves by Foreign Luxury at Home.",
  "* Vast Numbers throngd the fruitful Hive;Yet those vast Numbers made em thrive;Millions endeavouring to supplyEach others Lust and Vanity.",
  "* They put off hearings wilfully,To finger the refreshing fee.",
  "* Thus every Part was full of Vice,Yet the whole Mass a Paradise;Flatterd in Peace, and feard in Wars,They were th Esteem of Foreigners,And lavish of their Wealth and Lives,The Balance of all other Hives.",
  "* The worst of all the MultitudeDid something for the Common Good.",
  "* LuxuryEmployd a Million of the Poor,And odious Pride a Million more;Envy it self, and Vanity,Were Ministers of Industry;Their darling Folly, Fickleness,In Diet, Furniture and Dress,That strange ridiclous Vice, was madeThe very Wheel that turnd the Trade.",
  "* Thus Vice nursd Ingenuity,Which joind with Time and Industry,Had carryd Lifes Conveniences,Its real Pleasures, Comforts, Ease,To such a Height, the very PoorLivd better than the Rich before.",
  "* Then leave Complaints: Fools only striveTo make a Great an Honest Hive.Tenjoy the Worlds Conveniences,Be famd in War, yet live in Ease,Without great Vices, is a vainEutopia seated in the Brain.",
  "* So Vice is beneficial found,When its by Justice lopt and bound;Nay, where the People would be great,As necessary to the State,As Hunger is to make em eat.Bare Virtue cant make Nations liveIn Splendor; they, that would reviveA Golden Age, must be as free,For Acorns, as for Honesty.",
  "* The first Rudiments of Morality, broachd by skilful Politicians, to render Men useful to each other as well as tractable, were chiefly contrived that the Ambitious might reap the more Benefit from, and govern vast Numbers of them with the greater Ease and Security.",
  "* It is visible then that it was not any Heathen Religion or other Idolatrous Superstition, that first put Man upon crossing his Appetites and subduing his dearest Inclinations, but the skilful Management of wary Politicians; and the nearer we search into human Nature, the more we shall be convinced, that the Moral Virtues are the Political Offspring which Flattery begot upon Pride.",
  "* The Multitude will hardly believe the excessive Force of Education, and in the difference of Modesty between Men and Women ascribe that to Nature, which is altogether owing to early Instruction: Miss is scarce Three years old, but she is spoke to every Day to hide her Leg, and rebukd in good Earnest if she shews it; while Little Master at the same Age is bid to take up his Coats, and piss like a Man.",
  "* Because Impudence is a Vice, it does not follow that Modesty is a Virtue; it is built upon Shame, a Passion in our Nature, and may be either Good or Bad according to the Actions performd from that Motive.",
  "* People of Substance may Sin without being exposd for their stolen Pleasure; but Servants and the Poorer sort of Women have seldom an Opportunity of concealing a Big Belly, or at least the Consequences of it.",
  "* This laudable quality is commonly known by the name of Manners and Good-breeding, and consists in a Fashionable Habit, acquird by Precept and Example, of flattering the Pride and Selfishness of others, and concealing our own with Judgment and Dexterity.",
  "* If Courtezans and Strumpets were to be prosecuted with as much Rigour as some silly People would have it, what Locks or Bars would be sufficient to preserve the Honour of our Wives and Daughters?",
  "* What have the Aldermen, the Common-Council, or indeed all People of any Substance to do with the War, but to pay Taxes?  The Hardships and Fatigues of War that are personally sufferd, fall upon them that bear the Brunt of every Thing, the meanest Indigent Part of the Nation, the working slaving People.",
  "* I have often thought, if it was not for this Tyranny which Custom usurps over us, that Men of any tolerable Good-nature could never be reconcild to the killing of so many Animals for their daily Food, as long as the bountiful Earth so plentifully provides them with Varieties of vegetable Dainties.",
  "* But in such perfect Animals as Sheep and Oxen, in whom the Heart, the Brain and Nerves differ so little from ours, and in whom the Separation of the Spirits from the Blood, the Organs of Sense, and consequently Feeling it self, are the same as they are in Human Creatures; I cant imagine how a Man not hardened in Blood and Massacre, is able to see a violent Death, and the Pangs of it, without Concern. In answer to this, most People will think it sufficient to say, that all Things being allowd to be made for the Service of Man, there can be no Cruelty in putting Creatures to the use they were designd for; but I have heard Men make this Reply, whilst their Nature within them has reproachd them with the Falshood of the Assertion.",
  "* Some People are not to be persuaded to taste of any Creatures they have daily seen and been acquainted with, while they were alive; others extend their Scruple no further than to their own Poultry, and refuse to eat what they fed and took care of themselves; yet all of them will feed heartily and without Remorse on Beef, Mutton and Fowls when they are bought in the Market. In this Behaviour, methinks, there appears something like a Consciousness of Guilt, it looks as if they endeavord to save themselves from the Imputation of a Crime (which they know sticks somewhere) by removing the cause of it as far as they can from themselves; and I can discover in it some strong remains of Primitive Pity and Innocence, which all the arbitrary Power of Custom, and the violence of Luxury, have not yet been able to conquer. ",
  "* Tis only Man, mischievous Man, that can make Death a Sport. Nature taught your Stomach to crave nothing but Vegetables; but your violent Fondness to change, and greater Eagerness after Novelties, have prompted you to the Destruction of Animals without Justice or Necessity, perverted your Nature and warpd your Appetites which way soever your Pride or Luxury have calld them.",
  "* One good Man may take anothers Word, if they so agree, but a whole Nation ought never to trust to any Honesty, but what is built upon Necessity; for unhappy is the People, and their Constitution will be ever precarious, whose Welfare must depend upon the Virtues and Consciences of Ministers and Politicians.",
  "* The only thing of weight that can be said against modern Honour is, that it is directly opposite to Religion. The one bids you bear Injuries with Patience, the other tells you if you dont resent them, you are not fit to live.",
  "* Ashamed of the many Frailties they feel within, all Men endeavour to hide themselves, their Ugly Nakedness, from each other, and wrapping up the true Motives of their Hearts in the Specious Cloke of Sociableness, and their Concern for the publick Good, they are in hopes of concealing their filthy Appetites and the Deformity of their Desires.",
  "* We seldom call any body lazy, but such as we reckon inferior to us, and of whom we expect some Service.",
  "* Pride and Vanity have built more Hospitals than all the Virtues together.",
  "* No Habit or Quality is more easily acquird than Hypocrisy, nor any thing sooner learnd than to deny the Sentiments of our Hearts and the Principle we act from: But the Seeds of every Passion are innate to us, and no body comes into the World without them.",
  "* Knowledge both enlarges and multiplies our Desires, and the fewer things a Man wishes for, the more easily his Necessities may be supplyd.",
  "* There is no Intrinsick Worth in Money but what is alterable with the Times, and whether a Guinea goes for Twenty Pounds or for a Shilling, it is \u2026 the Labour of the Poor, and not the high and low value that is set on Gold or Silver, which all the Comforts of Life must arise from.",
  "* What a vast Traffick is drove, what a variety of Labour is performed in the World to the Maintenance of Thousands of Families that altogether depend on two silly if not odious Customs; the taking of Snuff and smoking of Tobacco; both which it is certain do infinitely more hurt than good to those that are addicted to them!",
  "* I flatter my self to have demonstrated that, neither the Friendly Qualities and kind Affections that are natural to Man, nor the real Virtues he is capable of acquiring by Reason and Self-Denial, are the Foundation of Society; but that what we call Evil in this World, Moral as well as Natural, is the grand Principle that makes us sociable Creatures, the solid Basis, the Life and Support of all Trades and Employments without Exception: That there we must look for the true Origin of all Arts and Sciences, and that the Moment Evil ceases, the Society must be spoiled, if not totally dissolved.",
  "* Private Vices by the dextrous Management of a skilful Politician may be turned into Publick Benefits.",
  "* The fallacy of that book is, that Mandeville defines neither vices nor benefits. He reckons among vices everything that gives pleasure. He takes the narrowest system of morality, monastick morality, which holds pleasure itself to be a vice, such as eating salt with our fish, because it makes it taste better; and he reckons wealth as a publick benefit, which is by no means always true. Pleasure of itself is not a vice.",
  "** The economic doctrine of Adam Smith is the doctrine of Mandeville set out in a form which is no longer paradoxical and literary, but rational and scientific."
