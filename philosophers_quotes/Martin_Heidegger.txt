  "* Those in the crossing must in the end know what is mistaken by all urging for intelligibility: that every thinking of being, all philosophy, can never be confirmed by \"facts,\" ie, by beings. Making itself intelligible is suicide for philosophy. Those who idolize \"facts\" never notice that their idols only shine in a borrowed light. They are also meant not to notice this; for thereupon they would have to be at a loss and therefore useless. But idolizers and idols are used wherever gods are in flight and so announce their nearness.",

  "* Everywhere we remain unfree and chained to technology, whether we passionately affirm or deny it.

  "* The Geschick of being: a child that plays... Why does it play, the great child of the world-play Heraclitus brought into view in the ai\u00f4n? It plays, because it plays. The \"because\" withers away in the play. The play is without \"why.\" It plays since it plays. It simply remains a play: the most elevated and the most profound. But this \"simply\" is everything, the one, the only... The question remains whether and how we, hearing the movements of this play, play along and accommodate ourselves to the play.",
  "* Philosophy will not be able to effect an immediate transformation of the present condition of the world. This is not only true of philosophy, but of all merely human thought and endeavor. Only a god can save us. The sole possibility that is left for us is to prepare a sort of readiness, through thinking and poeticizing, for the appearance of the god or for the absence of the god in the time of foundering [Untergang] for in the face of the god who is absent, we founder. Only a God Can Save Us.",
  "* From our human experience and history, at least as far as I am informed, I know that everything essential and great has only emerged when human beings had a home and were rooted in a tradition. Today\u2019s literature is, for instance, largely destructive. ",
  "* I see the situation of man in the world of planetary technicity not as an inexitricable and inescapable destiny, but I see the task of thought precisely in this, that within its own limits it helps man as such achieve a satisfactory relationship to the essence of technicity. National Socialism did indeed go in this direction. Those people, however, were far too poorly equipped for thought to arrive at a really explicit relationship to what is happening today and has been underway for the past 300 years.",
  "* Today we decide about metaphysics and about even more elevated things at philosophy conferences. For everything that is to be done these days we must first have a meeting, and here is how it works: people come together, constantly come together, and they all wait for one another to turn up so that the others will tell them how it is, and if it doesn\u2019t get said, never mind, everyone has had their say. It may very well be that all the talkers who are having their say have understood little of the matter in question, but still we believe that if we accumulate all that misunderstanding something like understanding will leap forth at the end of the day. Thus there are people today who travel from one meeting to the next and who are sustained by the confidence that something is really happening, that they\u2019ve actually done something; whereas, at bottom, they\u2019ve merely ducked out of work, seeking in chatter a place to build a nest for their helplessness\u2014a helplessness, it is true, that they will never understand.",
  "* It is said that \"being\" is the most universal and the emptiest concept. As such it resists every attempt at definition. Nor does this most universal and thus indefinable concept need any definition. Everybody uses it constantly and also already understands what is meant by it.",
  "* Every questioning is a seeking. Every seeking takes its direction beforehand from what is sought. Questioning is a knowing search for beings in their thatness and whatness.",
  "* But in fact there is no circle at all in the formulation of our question. Beings can be determined in their being without the explicit concept of the meaning of being having to be already available. If this were not so there could not have been as yet any ontological knowledge. And prob\u00adably no one would deny the factual existence of such knowledge. It is true that \"being\" is \"presupposed\" in all previous ontology, but not as an available concept-not as the sort of thing we are seeking.",
  "* Our elucidations of the preliminary concept of phenomenology show that its essential character does not consist in its actuality as a philosophical \"movement.\" Higher than actuality stands possibility. We can understand phenomenology solely by seizing upon it as a possibility.",

  "* The domination of the public way in which things have been interpreted has already decided upon even the possibilities of being attuned, that is, about the basic way in which Da-sein lets itself be affected by the world. The they prescribes that attunement, it determines what and how one \"sees.\"",
  "* In order to remain silent Da-sein must have something to say.",
  "* Nevertheless, the ultimate business of philosophy is to preserve the force of the most elemental words in which Dasein expresses itself, and to keep the common understanding from levelling them off to that unintelligibility which functions in turn as a source of pseudo-problems.",

  "* Plato has preserved in the Theaetetus - the story is that Thales, while occupied in studying the heavens above and looking up, fell into a well. A good-looking and whimsical maid from Thrace laughed at him and told him that while he might passionately want to know all things in the universe, the things in front of his very nose  and feet were unseen by him.\" Plato added: \"This jest also fits all those who become involved in Philosophy.\" Therefore, the question, What is a thing?\" must always be rated as one that causes housemaids to laugh. p. 3",
  "* Kant speaks of the \"thing-in-itself\" (Ding an sich) in order to distinguish it from the \"thing-for-us\" (Ding fur uns), that is, as a \"phenomenon.\"  A thing-in-itself is that which is not approachable through experience as are the rocks, plants, and animals. Every thing-for-us is as a thing and also a thing-in-itself, which means that it is recognized absolutely withing the absolute knowledge of God. But not every thing-in-itself is also a thing-for-us: God, for instance, is a thing-in-itself, as Kant uses the word, according to the meaning of Christian theology. p. 5",
  "* The particularity (Jeweiligkeit) os the places and their manifoldness are grounded in space, and the particularity of the time points is grounded in time. That basic characteristic of the thing, that essential determination of the thingness of the thing to be this one (je dieses), is grounded in the essence of space and time. Our question \"What is a thing?\" includes, therefore, the questions \"What is space?\" and \"What is time?\" It is customary to speak of of them both together. p. 16",
  "* There is no information about the thingness of the thing without knowledge of the kind of truth in which the thing stands. But there is no information about this truth of the thing without knowledge of the thingness of the thing whose truth is in question. Where are we to get a foothold? The ground slips away under us. Perhaps we are already close to falling into the well. At any rate the housemaids are already laughing. p. 27",
  "* \"Here is the chalk.\" This is a truth; and here and the now hereby characterize the chalk so that we emphasize by saying; the chalk, which means \"this.\" We take a scrap of paper and we write the truth down: \"Here is the chalk.\" We lay this written statement beside the thing of which it is the truth. After the lecture is finished both doors are opened, the classroom is aired, there will be a draft, and the scrap of paper, let us suppose, will flutter out into the corridor. A student finds it on his way to the cafeteria, reads the sentence. \"Here is the chalk,\" and ascertains that this is not true at all. Through the draft the truth has become an untruth. Strange that a truth should depend on a gust of wind.  ... We have made the truth about the chalk independent of us and entrusted it to a scrap of paper. p. 29-30",
  "* \"What is a thing?\" is historical, because every report of the past, that is of the preliminaries to the question about the thing, is concerned with something static. This kind of historical reporting is an explicit shutting down of history, whereas it is, after all, a happening. We question historically if we ask what is still happening even if it seems to be past. We ask what is still happening and whether we remain equal to this happening so that it can really develop. p. 43",
  "* Do the essences of proposition and of the truth determine themselves from out of the essence of the thing, or does the essence of the thing determine itself from out of the essence of the proposition? The question is posed as an either/or. However does this either/or itself suffice? Are the essence of the thing and the essence of the proposition only built as mirror images because both of them together determine themselves from out of the same but deeper lying root? However, what and where can be this common ground for the essence of the thing and of the proposition and of their origin? The unconditioned (Unbedingt)? We stated at the beginning that what conditions the essense of the thing in its thingness can no longer itself be thing and conditioned, it must be an unconditioned (Un-bedingtes). p. 47",
  "* Kants philosophy shifts for the first time the whole of modern thought and being (Desein) into the clarity and transparency of the foundation (Begrundung). This determines every attitude toward knowledge since then, as well as the bounds (Abgrenzungen) and appraisals of the sciences in the nineteenth century up to the present time. Therein Kant towers so far above all who precede and follow that even those who reject him or go beyond him still remain entirely dependent upon him. p. 55-56",
  "* Mathematics is as little a natural science as philosophy is one of the humanities. Philosophy in its essence belongs as little in the philosophical faculty as mathematics belongs to natural science. To house philosophy and mathematics in this way today seems to be a blemish or a mistake in the catalog of the universities. Plato put over the entrance to his Academy the words: \"Let no one who has not grasped the mathematical enter here!\" p. 69,75",
  "* Modern philosophy is usually considered to have begun with Descartes (1596-1650), who lived a generation after Galileo. The following is the usual image of Descartes and his philosophy: During the Middle Ages philosophy stood - if it stood independently at all - under the exclusive domination of theology and gradually degenerated into a mere analysis of concepts and elucidations of traditional opinion and propositions. It petrified into an academic knowledge which no longer concerned man and was unable to illuminate reality as a whole. Then Descartes appeared and liberated philosophy from this position. He began by doubting everything, but this doubt finally did run into something which could no longer be doubted, for, inasmuch as the skeptic doubts, he cannot doubt that he, the skeptic, is present and must be present in order to doubt at all. As I doubt I must admit that \"I am.\" The \"I,\" accordingly, is the indubitable. As a doubter, Descartes forced men into doubt in this way; he led them to think of themselves, as their \"I.\" Thus the \"I,\" human subjectivity, came to be declared the center of thought.  From here originated the I-viewpoint of modern times and its subjectivism. p. 98-99",
  "* Kant stands in the tradition of the Leibniz-Woffian school. He made the thinking through of English philosophy, especially Hume, fruitful for the formation of his own questioning. On the whole, however, the school-philosophy of Leibniz-Wolffian stamp remained predominant in Kant. He used Metaphysica 1739,  by Alexander Baumgarten (1714-1762) in his lectures in metaphysics and appreciated this textbook \"especially for the richness and precision of its teaching method.\" p. 114",
  "* In everything well known something worthy of thought still lurks.",
  "* If in Nietzsche\u2019s thinking the prior tradition of Western thought is gathered and completed in a decisive respect, then the confrontation with Nietzsche becomes one with all Western thought hitherto.",
  "* \u201cFor many, abstract thinking is toil; for me, on good days, it is feast and frenzy.\u201d (XIV, 24) Abstract thinking a feast? The highest form of human existence? \u2026 \u201cThe feast implies: pride, exuberance, frivolity; mockery of all earnestness and respectability; a divine affirmation of oneself, out of animal plenitude and perfection\u2014all obviously states to which the Christian may not honestly say Yes. The feast is paganism par excellence.\u201d (WM, 916). For that reason, we might add that thinking never takes place in Christianity. That is to say, there is no Christian philosophy. There is no true philosophy that could be determined anywhere else than from within itself.",
  "* For anyone who at the end of Western philosophy can and must still question philosophically, the decisive question is no longer merely \u201cWhat basic character do beings manifest?\u201d or \u201cHow may the being of beings be characterized?\u201d but \u201cWhat is this \u2018being\u2019 itself?\u201d The decisive question is that of \u201cthe meaning of being,\u201d not merely that of the being of beings.",

  "* Eternity, not as a static \u201cnow,\u201d nor as a sequence of \u201cnows\u201d rolling off into the infinite, but as the \u201cnow\u201d that bends back into itself. \u2026 Thinking the most difficult thought of philosophy means thinking being as time.",
  "* The critique of the highest values hitherto does not simply refute them or declare them invalid. It is rather a matter of displaying their origins as impositions which must affirm precisely what ought to be negated by the values established.",
  "* In Nietzsche\u2019s view nihilism is not a Weltanschauung that occurs at some time and place or another; it is rather the basic character of what happens in Occidental history.",
  "* In contrast to \u201cBlessed are they who do not see and still believe,\u201d he speaks of \u201cseeing and still not believing.\u201d",
  "* If beings are grasped as will to power, the \u201cshould\u201d which is supposed to hang suspended over them, against which they might be measured, becomes superfluous. If life itself is will to power, it is itself the ground, principium, of valuation. Then a \u201cshould\u201d does not determine being. Being determines a \u201cshould.\u201d \u201cWhen we talk of values we are speaking under the inspiration or optics of life: life itself compels us to set up values; life itself values through us whenever we posit values.\u201d (VIII, 89)",
  "* The small are always dependent on the great; they are \u201csmall\u201d precisely because they think they are independent. The great thinker is one who can hear what is greatest in the work of other \u201cgreats\u201d and who can transform it in an original manner.",
  "* Nietzsche \u2026 does not shy from conscious exaggeration and one-sided formulations of his thought, believing that in this way he can most clearly set in relief what in his vision and in his inquiry is different from the run-of-the-mill.",
  "* This is precisely what is decisive in Nietzsche\u2019s conception of art, that he sees it in its essential entirety in terms of the artist; this he does consciously and in explicit opposition to that conception of art which represents it in terms of those who \u201cenjoy\u201d and \u201cexperience\u201d it.That is a guiding principle of Nietzsche\u2019s teaching on art: art must be grasped in terms of creators and producers, not recipients. Nietzsche expresses it unequivocally in the following words (WM, 811): \u201cOur aesthetics heretofore has been a woman\u2019s aesthetics, inasmuch as only the recipients of art have formulated their experiences of \u2018what is beautiful.\u2019 In all philosophy to date the artist is missing.\u201d Philosophy of art means \u201caesthetics\u201d for Nietzsche too\u2014but masculine aesthetics, not feminine aesthetics. The question of art is the question of the artist as the productive, creative one; his experiences of what is beautiful must provide the standard.",
  "** The will to the \u201ctrue world\u201d in the sense of Plato and Christianity \u2026 is in truth a no-saying to our present world, precisely the one in which art is at home.",
  "* The relation of feeling toward art and its bringing-forth can be one of production or one of reception and enjoyment.",
  "* We do not \u201chave\u201d a body; rather, we \u201care\u201d bodily.",
  "* Nietzsche understands the aesthetic state of the observer and recipient on the basis of the state of the creator. Thus the effect of the artwork is nothing else than a reawakening of the creator\u2019s state in the one who enjoys the artwork. Observation of art follows in the wake of creation. Nietzsche says (SM, 821), \u201c\u2014the effect of artworks is arousal of the art-creating state, rapture.\u201d",
  "* Enjoyment of the work consists in participation in the creative state of the artist.",
  "* Form displays the relation [to beings] itself as the state of original comportment toward beings, the festive state in which the being itself in its essence is celebrated and thus for the first time placed in the open.",
  "* We think of beauty as being most worthy of reverence. But what is most worthy of reverence lights up only where the magnificent strength to revere is alive. To revere is not a thing for the petty and lowly, the incapacitated and underdeveloped. It is a matter of tremendous passion; only what flows from such passion is in the grand style.",
  "* The word \u201cart\u201d does not designate the concept of a mere eventuality; it is a concept of rank.",
  "* Who is to determine what the perfect is? It could only be those who are themselves perfect and who therefore know what it means. Here yawns the abyss of that circularity in which the whole of human Dasein moves. What health is, only the healthy can say. Yet healthfulness is measured according to the essential starting point of health. What truth is, only one who is truthful can discern; but the one who is truthful is determined according to the essential starting point of truth."
