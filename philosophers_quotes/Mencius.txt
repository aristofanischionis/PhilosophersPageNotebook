  "* If the king loves music, there is little wrong in the land.",
  "* Mencius went to see King Huei of Liang. The king said, \"Venerable sir, since you have not counted it far to come here, a distance of a thousand li, may I presume that you are provided with counsels to profit my kingdom?\" Mencius replied, \"Why must your Majesty use that word \"profit\"? What I am provided with, are counsels to benevolence and righteousness, and these are my only topics.\"",
  "* He who outrages benevolence is called a ruffian: he who outrages righteousness is called a villain. I have heard of the cutting off of the villain Chow, but I have not heard of the putting of a ruler to death.",
  "* The feeling of commiseration is the beginning of humanity; the feeling of shame and dislike is the beginning of righteousness; the feeling of deference and compliance is the beginning of propriety; and the feeling of right or wrong is the beginning of wisdom.

  "* The superior man has three things in which he delights, and to be ruler over the kingdom is not one of them. That his father and mother are both alive, and that the condition of his brothers affords no cause for anxiety;\u2014this is one delight. That, when looking up, he has no occasion for shame before Heaven, and, below, he has no occasion to blush before men;\u2014this is a second delight. That he can get from the whole kingdom the most talented individuals, and teach and nourish them;\u2014this is the third delight.",
  "** Most precious are the people; next come the spirits of land and grain; and last, the kings.",
  "* Before a man can do things there must be things he will not do."
