  "* The Democratic Party has exploited black leadership.",
  "* The entrapment of black voters in the Democratic party has been a disaster, and it\u2019s one of the reasons that progress on {{w|racial equality}} has been infinitesimal or at best incremental since the {{w|Civil Rights movement}}.",
  "* I think American white conservatives and white liberals are, by and large, both racist. But the liberals believe they\u2019re not racists\u2014in fact, they believe in nothing else with so much commitment. They insist they dont have a racist bone in their bodies; they dont even see race; they were over that a long time ago.",
  "* What white people learned from the Civil Rights era was how not to appear to be racists, even to themselves. They came away from the 1960s knowing that racism was a matter of using the wrong words or expressing the wrong attitudes publicly. They trained their internal monologues to mirror an egalitarian or deracinated public discourse: no slurs, just a continual stream of {{w|euphemisms}}. That was the essence of white anti-racism: dont say the wrong thing.",
  "* Behind all the Great-Society-style {{w|housing}}/anti-pathological}}. The white {{w|power structure}}s are always diagnosing the dysfunctions and prescribing a cure for the high-rise housing projects, {{w|compulsory education}} and standardized testing, wars on poverty or drugs, self-esteem seminars. A good portion of the African-American population was simply institutionalized or interned, in public housing complexes, in urban schools, and in one of the biggest prison systems the world has ever known. It all amounts to a sprawling race gulag in which people are both dependent and hedged about with restrictions.",
  "* {{w|Affirmative action}}, where we pluck your best, brightest, most ambitious or conformist, and invite them into our elite institutions. This has had some effect on upward mobility, but its primary purpose is to parade as conspicuously as possible the non-racism of the people who run the institutions. It\u2019s primarily another way for white people to mutter to themselves, \u201cI am not a racist.\u201d And it\u2019s had the effect of dividing black communities and families, like mass incarceration in the other direction.",
  "* American progressivism maintains a hyper-consciousness of race, obsessively emphasizing its centrality to human identity and relentlessly breaking down populations by racial categories. If nothing else, aggressive affirmative action requires that everyone be identified racially. When it\u2019s time to measure political opinions, nothing is as salient as race, and the Trump phenomenon gets explained almost exclusively in terms of racial distributions, as white rage or white nationalism.",
  "* The two-party system is breaking down into a race system.",
  "* Since Jesse Jackson ran for president, and perhaps up until the {{w|Black Lives Matter}} movement, the Democratic Party has dominated and used black leadership.",
  "* The fact that black voters have voted over 90 percent Democratic for decades leaves them almost wholly without power. Democrats\u2014paradigmatically, the Clintons\u2014feint in their direction during general elections, trying to assure turnout and using them to bash Republicans as bigots and\u2014in the usual fashion\u2014as emblems of their own goodness.",
  "* Theres no reason for Republicans to waste any time on black voters; there are no votes there under any conditions. Rand Paul went to Ferguson and Baltimore to talk racial healing: no one cared or even noticed.",
  "* The progressive approach has left American racial inequality intractable: a permanent, institutionalized, chronic, insoluble condition. And the left black people without any political leverage."
