  "* Every measurable thing except numbers is imagined in the manner of a continuous quantity. Therefore, for the mensuration of such a thing, it is necessary that points, lines, and surfaces, or their properties, be imagined. For in them... measure or ratio is initially found... Therefore, every intensity which can be acquired successively ought to be imagined by a straight line perpendicularly erected on some point of the space or subject of the intensible thing, e.g., a quality... And since the quantity or ratio of lines is better known and is more readily conceived by us\u2014nay the line is in the first species of continua, therefore such intensity ought to be imagined by lines... Therefore, equal intensities are designated by equal lines, a double intensity by a double line, and always in the same way if one proceeds proportionally.",
  "* Since money belongs to the community \u2026 it would seem that the community may control it as it wills, and therefore may make as much profit from alteration as it likes, and treat money as its own property.",
  "* I am of the opinion that the main and final cause why the prince pretends to the power of altering the coinage is the profit or gain which he can get from it.",
  "* Whenever kingship approaches tyranny it is near its end, for by this it becomes ripe for division, change of dynasty, or total destruction, especially in a temperate climate \u2026 where men are habitually, morally and naturally free.",
  "* People marvel at \u2026 things only because they rarely happen; but the causes for these are as apparent as for others \u2026 For example, at night a fearful man who sees a wolf in the fields, or a cat in his room, will immediately assert and judge that it is an enemy or a devil \u2026 because he fixes his imagination on these and fears them. And a person devout and rapt [in ecstasy] will judge that it is an angel \u2026 A vigorous imagining of a retained species, then, together with a small external appearance or with an imbalance of some internal disposition \u2026 produces marvelous appearances in healthy as well as in sick people.",
  "* God in His infinite grandeur without any quantity and absolutely indivisible, which we call immensity, is necessarily all in every extension or space or place which exists or can be imagined.",
  "* The heavenly bodies move with such regularity, orderliness, and symmetry that it is truly a marvel; and they continue always to act in this manner ceaselessly, following the established system, without increasing or reducing speed and continuing without respite, as the Scripture says: Summer and winter, night and day they never rest."
