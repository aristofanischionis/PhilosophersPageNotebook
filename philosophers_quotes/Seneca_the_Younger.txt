For it is more of an accomplishment to break one\u2019s way through difficulties than to keep joy within bounds.",
  "* There stood Mucius, despising the enemy and despising the fire, and watched his hand as it dripped blood over the fire on his enemy\u2019s altar, until Porsenna, envying the fame of the hero whose punishment he was advocating, ordered the fire to be removed against the will of the victim.",
  "* I cannot help believing that Mucius was all the more lucky because he manipulated the flames as calmly as if he were holding out his hand to the manipulator. He had wiped out all his previous mistakes; he finished the war unarmed and maimed; and with that stump of a hand he conquered two kings.",
  "* I should prefer to be free from torture; but if the time comes when it must be endured, I shall desire that I may conduct myself therein with bravery, honour, and courage. Of course I prefer that war should not occur; but if war does occur, I shall desire that I may nobly endure the wounds, the starvation, and all that the exigency of war brings. Nor am I so mad as to crave illness; but if I must suffer illness, I shall desire that I may do nothing which shows lack of restraint, and nothing that is unmanly. The conclusion is, not that hardships are desirable, but that virtue is desirable, which enables us patiently to endure hardships.",
  "* Now a life of honour includes various kinds of conduct; it may include the chest in which Regulus was confined, or the wound of Cato which was torn open by Cato\u2019s own hand, or the exile of Rutilius, or the cup of poison which removed Socrates from gaol to heaven.",
  "* Clothe yourself with a hero\u2019s courage, and withdraw for a little space from the opinions of the common man.

  "* Do you ask me whom I have conquered? Neither the Persians, nor the far-off Medes, nor any warlike race that lies beyond the Dahae; not these, but greed, ambition, and the fear of death that has conquered the conquerors of the world.",

  "* Would you not think him an utter fool who wept because he was not alive a thousand years ago? And is he not just as much of a fool who weeps because he will not be alive a thousand years from now? It is all the same; you will not be, and you were not. Neither of these periods of time belongs to you.",
  "* So near at hand is freedom, and is anyone still a slave?",
  "* What else is there which you would regret to have taken from you? Friends? But who can be a friend to you? Country? What? Do you think enough of your country to be late to dinner?

  "** For sometimes it is an act of bravery even to live. ",
  "* There is no sorrow in the world, when we have escaped from the fear of death.",
  "* No man can suffer both severely and for a long time; Nature, who loves us most tenderly, has so constituted us as to make pain either endurable or short.",
  "* \u201cIt is nothing\u2014a trifling matter at most; keep a stout heart and it will soon cease\u201d; then in thinking it slight, you will make it slight. Everything depends on opinion; ambition, luxury, greed, hark back to opinion. It is according to opinion that we suffer.",
  "* Two elements must therefore be rooted out once for all\u2014the fear of future suffering, and the recollection of past suffering; since the latter no longer concerns me, and the former concerns me not yet.",
  "* Is it for this purpose that we are strong\u2014that we may have light burdens to bear?",
  "* Meanwhile, hold fast to this thought, and grip it close: yield not to adversity; trust not to prosperity; keep before your eyes the full scope of Fortune\u2019s power, as if she would surely do whatever is in her power to do.",
  "** Our feeling about every obligation depends in each case upon the spirit in which the benefit is conferred; we weigh not the bulk of the gift, but the quality of the good-will which prompted it.",
  "** My master Attalus used to say: \"Evil herself drinks the largest portion of her own poison.\" The poison which serpents carry for the destruction of others, and secrete without harm to themselves, is not like this poison; for this sort is ruinous to the possessor.",

  "** Drunkenness is nothing but voluntary madness.",
  "** It is a rough road that leads to the heights of greatness.",
  "* But he has no fear; unconquered he looks down from a lofty height upon his sufferings.",
  "* Thus no fortune, no external circumstance, can shut off the wise man from action. For the very thing which engages his attention prevents him from attending to other things. He is ready for either outcome: if it brings goods, he controls them; if evils, he conquers them.",
  "* So the wise man will develop virtue, if he may, in the midst of wealth, or, if not, in poverty; if possible, in his own country\u2014if not, in exile; if possible, as a commander\u2014if not, as a common soldier; if possible, in sound health\u2014if not, enfeebled. Whatever fortune he finds, he will accomplish therefrom something noteworthy.",
  "** A sword by itself does not slay; it is merely the weapon used by the slayer.",
  "** It is better, of course, to know useless things than to know nothing.",
  "** Just as an enemy is more dangerous to a retreating army, so every trouble that fortune brings attacks us all the harder if we yield and turn our backs.",
  "* A thatched roof once covered free men; under marble and gold dwells slavery.",
  "* Alexander, king of Macedon, began to study geometry; unhappy man, because he would thereby learn how puny was that earth of which he had seized but a fraction! Unhappy man, I repeat, because he was bound to understand that he was bearing a false title. For who can be \u201cgreat\u201d in that which is puny?",
  "* Imagine that nature is saying to us: \u201cThose things of which you complain are the same for all. I cannot give anything easier to any man, but whoever wishes will make things easier for himself.\u201d In what way? By equanimity. You must suffer pain, and thirst, and hunger, and old age too, if a longer stay among men shall be granted you; you must be sick, and you must suffer loss and death.",
  "* That man, I declare, is happy whom nothing makes less strong than he is; he keeps to the heights, leaning upon none but himself; for one who sustains himself by any prop may fall.",

  "** Dont ask for what youll wish you hadnt got.",
  "** We often want one thing and pray for another, not telling the truth even to the gods.",
  "** We are mad, not only individually, but nationally. We check manslaughter and isolated murders; but what of war and the much-vaunted crime of slaughtering whole peoples? There are no limits to our greed, none to our cruelty. And as long as such crimes are committed by stealth and by individuals, they are less harmful and less portentous; but cruelties are practised in accordance with acts of senate and popular assembly, and the public is bidden to do that which is forbidden to the individual. Deeds that would be punished by loss of life when committed in secret, are praised by us because uniformed generals have carried them out. Man, naturally the gentlest class of being, is not ashamed to revel in the blood of others, to wage war, and to entrust the waging of war to his sons, when even dumb beasts and wild beasts keep the peace with one another. Against this overmastering and widespread madness philosophy has become a matter of greater effort, and has taken on strength in proportion to the strength which is gained by the opposition forces.",
  "* As our acts and our thoughts are, so will our lives be.",
  "** And yet life, Lucilius, is really a battle.",
  "* For this reason those who are tossed about at sea, who proceed uphill and downhill over toilsome crags and heights, who go on campaigns that bring the greatest danger, are heroes and front-rank fighters; but persons who live in rotten luxury and ease while others toil, are mere turtle-doves safe only because men despise them.",
  "* \u201cOf all these experiences that seem so frightful, none is insuperable. Separate trials have been over- come by many: fire by Mucius, crucifixion by Regulus, poison by Socrates, exile by Rutilius, and a sword-inflicted death by Cato; therefore, let us also overcome something.\u201d",
  "* Whoever complains about the death of anyone, is complaining that he was a man. Everyone is bound by the same terms: he who is privileged to be born, is destined to die.",
  "* Accept in an unruffled spirit that which is inevitable.",
  "* But how foolish it is to set out one\u2019s life, when one is not even owner of the morrow!",
  "* Therefore, my dear Lucilius, begin at once to live, and count each separate day as a separate life.",
  "* The point is, not how long you live, but how nobly you live. And often this living nobly means that you cannot live long.",
  "* Socrates is reported to have replied, when a certain person complained of having received no benefit from his travels: \u201cIt serves you right! You travelled in your own company!\u201d",
  "* What profit is there in crossing the sea and in going from one city to another? If you would escape your troubles, you need not another place but another personality. Perhaps you have reached Athens, or perhaps Rhodes; choose any state you fancy, how does it matter what its character may be? You will be bringing to it your own.",
  "* \u201cNew friends, however, will not be the same.\u201d No, nor will you yourself remain the same; you change with every day and every hour.",
  "** If you are wise, mingle these two elements: do not hope without despair, or despair without hope.",
  "* Or, if you enjoy living with Greeks also, spend your time with Socrates and with Zeno: the former will show you how to die if it be necessary; the latter how to die before it is necessary. Live with Chrysippus, with Posidonius: they will make you acquainted with things earthly and things heavenly; they will bid you work hard over something more than neat turns of language and phrases mouthed forth for the entertainment of listeners; they will bid you be stout of heart and rise superior to threats. The only harbour safe from the seething storms of this life is scorn of the future, a firm stand, a readiness to receive Fortune\u2019s missiles full in the breast, neither skulking nor turning the back.",
  "* This spirit thrusts itself forward, confident of commendation and esteem. It is superior to all, monarch of all it surveys; hence it should be subservient to nothing, finding no task too heavy, and nothing strong enough to weigh down the shoulders of a man.",
  "** But how much more highly do I think of these men! They can do these things, but decline to do them. To whom that ever tried have these tasks proved false? To what man did they not seem easier in the doing? Our lack of confidence is not the result of difficulty. The difficulty comes from our lack of confidence.",
  "* He maintained this attitude up to the very end, and no man ever saw Socrates too much elated or too much depressed. Amid all the disturbance of Fortune, he was undisturbed.",
  "* Do you desire another case? Take that of the younger Marcus Cato, with whom Fortune dealt in a more hostile and more persistent fashion. But he withstood her, on all occasions, and in his last moments, at the point of death, showed that a brave man can live in spite of Fortune, can die in spite of her. His whole life was passed either in civil warfare, or under a political regime which was soon to breed civil war.",
  "* No one ever saw Cato change, no matter how often the state changed: he kept himself the same in all circumstances\u2014in the praetorship, in defeat, under accusation, in his province, on the platform, in the army, in death.",
  "* And this is the vote which [Cato] casts concerning them both: \u201cIf Caesar wins, I slay myself; if Pompey, I go into exile.\u201d What was there for a man to fear who, whether in defeat or in victory, had assigned to himself a doom which might have been assigned to him by his enemies in their utmost rage? So he died by his own decision.",
  "* You see that man can endure toil: Cato, on foot, led an army through African deserts. You see that thirst can be endured: he marched over sun-baked hills, dragging the remains of a beaten army and with no train of supplies, undergoing lack of water and wearing a heavy suit of armour; always the last to drink of the few springs which they chanced to find. You see that honour, and dishonour too, can be despised: for they report that on the very day when Cato was defeated at the elections, he played a game of ball. You see also that man can be free from fear of those above him in rank: for Cato attacked Caesar and Pompey simultaneously, at a time when none dared fall foul of the one without endeavouring to oblige the other. You see that death can be scorned as well as exile: Cato inflicted exile upon himself and finally death, and war all the while.",
  "* If you set a high value on liberty, you must set a low value on everything else.",
  "* Besides, he who is feared, fears also; no one has been able to arouse terror and live in peace of mind.",
  "** Just as we suffer from excess in all things, so we suffer from excess in literature; thus we learn our lessons, not for life, but for the lecture room.",
  "* And we cannot change this order of things; but what we can do is to acquire stout hearts, worthy of good men, thereby courageously enduring chance and placing ourselves in harmony with Nature.",
  "* They have been spoken by Plato, spoken by Zeno, spoken by Chrysippus or by Posidonius, and by a whole host of Stoics as numerous as excellent. I shall show you how men can prove their words to be their own: it is by doing what they have been talking about.",
  "* Let words proceed as they please, provided only your soul keeps its own sure order, provided your soul is great and holds unruffled to its ideals, pleased with itself on account of the very things which displease others, a soul that makes life the test of its progress, and believes that its knowledge is in exact proportion to its freedom from desire and its freedom from fear.",
  "* Tell me what to avoid, what to seek, by what studies to strengthen my tottering mind, how I may rebuff the waves that strike me abeam and drive me from my course, by what means I may be able to cope with all my evils, and by what means I can be rid of the calamities that have plunged in upon me and those into which I myself have plunged. Teach me how to bear the burden of sorrow without a groan on my part, and how to bear prosperity without making others groan; also, how to avoid waiting for the ultimate and inevitable end, and to beat a retreat of my own free will, when it seems proper to me to do so.",
  "* Why then do you occupy me with the words rather than with the works of wisdom? Make me braver, make me calmer, make me the equal of Fortune, make me her superior.",
  "* I will tell you: that perfect man, who has attained virtue, never cursed his luck, and never received the results of chance with dejection; he believed that he was citizen and soldier of the universe, accepting his tasks as if they were his orders. Whatever happened, he did not spurn it, as if it were evil and borne in upon him by hazard; he accepted it as if it were assigned to be his duty. \u201cWhatever this may be,\u201dhe says, \u201cit is my lot; it is rough and it is hard, but I must work diligently at the task.\u201d",
  "** A great step towards independence is a good-humored stomach, one that is willing to endure rough treatment.",
  "*The customs of that most criminal nation have gained such strength that they have now been received in all lands. The conquered have given laws to the conquerors.",
  "** He who receives a benefit with gratitude, repays the first installment of it.",
  "** Valor withers without adversity.",
  "** Toward good men God has the mind of a father, he cherishes for them a manly love, and he says, \"Let them be harassed by toil, by suffering, by losses, in order that they may gather true strength.\" Bodies grown fat through sloth are weak, and not only labour, but even movement and their very weight cause them to break down. Unimpaired prosperity cannot withstand a single blow; but he who has struggled constantly with his ills becomes hardened through suffering; and yields to no misfortune; nay, even if he falls, he still fights upon his knees.",
  "** \"Although,\" said he [Cato], \"all the world has fallen under one mans sway, although Caesars legions guard the land, his fleets the sea, and Caesars troops beset the city gates, yet Cato has a way of escape; with one single hand he will open a wide path to freedom. This sword, unstained and blameless even in civil war, shall at last do good and noble service: the freedom which it could not give to his country it shall give to Cato!",
  "** Why does God afflict the best of men with ill-health, or sorrow, or other troubles? Because in the army the most hazardous services are assigned to the bravest soldiers: a general sends his choicest troops to attack the enemy in a midnight ambuscade, to reconnoitre his line of march, or to drive the hostile garrisons from their strong places. No one of these men says as he begins his march, \" The general has dealt hardly with me,\" but \"He has judged well of me.\"",
  "** Fire tries gold, misfortune tries brave men.",
  "** A good judge condemns wrongful acts, but does not hate them.",
  "** No one is able to rule unless he is also able to be ruled.",
  "** The cause of anger is the belief that we are injured; this belief, therefore, should not be lightly entertained. We ought not to fly into a rage even when the injury appears to be open and distinct: for some false things bear the semblance of truth. We should always allow some time to elapse, for time discloses the truth.",
  "** No man expects such exact fidelity as a traitor.",
  "** A large part of mankind is angry not with the sins, but with the sinners.",
  "** This is the worst trait of minds rendered arrogant by prosperity, they hate those whom they have injured.",
  "** If any one is angry with you, meet his anger by returning benefits for it: a quarrel which is only taken up on one side falls to the ground: it takes two men to fight.",
  "** He who has injured thee was either stronger or weaker than thee. If weaker, spare him; if stronger, spare thyself.",
  "** I do not trust my eyes to tell me what a man is: I have a better and more trustworthy light by which I can distinguish what is true from what is false: let the mind find out what is good for the mind.",
  "** All savageness is a sign of weakness.",
  "** It is not that we have a short space of time, but that we waste much of it. Life is long enough.",
  "* We are all chained to fortune: the chain of one is made of gold, and wide, while that of another is short and rusty. But what difference does it make? The same prison surrounds all of us, and even those who have bound others are bound themselves; unless perchance you think that a chain on the left side is lighter. Honors bind one man, wealth another; nobility oppresses some, humility others; some are held in subjection by an external power, while others obey the tyrant within; banishments keep some in one place, the priesthood others. All life is slavery. Therefore each one must accustom himself to his own condition and complain about it as little as possible, and lay hold of whatever good is to be found near him. Nothing is so bitter that a calm mind cannot find comfort in it. Small tablets, because of the writers skill, have often served for many purposes, and a clever arrangement has often made a very narrow piece of land habitable. Apply reason to difficulties; harsh circumstances can be softened, narrow limits can be widened, and burdensome things can be made to press less severely on those who bear them cleverly.",
  "* That man lives badly who does not know how to die well.",
  "* Should I be surprised that dangers which have always surrounded me should at last attack me? A great part of mankind, when about to sail, do not think of a storm. I shall never be ashamed of a reporter of bad news in a good cause.",
  "* Virtue runs no risk of becoming contemptible by being exposed to view, and it is better to be despised for simplicity than to be tormented by continual hypocrisy.",
  "* Our minds must have relaxation: rested, they will rise up better and keener. Just as we must not force fertile fields (for uninterrupted production will quickly exhaust them), so continual labor will break the power of our minds. They will recover their strength, however, after they have had a little freedom and relaxation.",
  "* Whether we believe the Greek poet, \"it is sometimes even pleasant to be mad\", or Plato, \"he who is master of himself has knocked in vain at the doors of poetry\"; or Aristotle, \"no great genius was without a mixture of insanity\"; the mind cannot express anything lofty and above the ordinary unless inspired. When it despises the common and the customary, and with sacred inspiration rises higher, then at length it sings something grander than that which can come from mortal lips. It cannot attain anything sublime and lofty so long as it is sane: it must depart from the customary, swing itself aloft, take the bit in its teeth, carry away its rider and bear him to a height whither he would have feared to ascend alone.",
  "** Death is a release from and an end of all pains: beyond it our sufferings cannot extend: it restores us to the peaceful rest in which we lay before we were born. If anyone pities the dead, he ought also to pity those who have not been born. Death is neither a good nor a bad thing, for that alone which is something can be a good or a bad thing: but that which is nothing, and reduces all things to nothing, does not hand us over to either fortune, because good and bad require some material to work upon. Fortune cannot take ahold of that which Nature has let go, nor can a man be unhappy if he is nothing.",
  "** What need is there to weep over parts of life? The whole of it calls for tears.",
  "** Nothing lasts forever, few things even last for long: all are susceptible of decay in one way or another; moreover all that begins also ends.",
  "** A great fortune is a great slavery.",
  "*Growth is slow but collapse is rapid.",
  "*It would be some consolation for the feebleness of ourselves and our works, if all things should perish as slowly as they come into being; but as it is, increases are of sluggish growth, but the way to ruin is rapid. ",
  "* Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by rulers as useful.",
  "*Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.",
  "** If you wish to be loved, love."
