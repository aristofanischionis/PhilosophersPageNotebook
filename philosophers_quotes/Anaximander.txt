  "* All things must in equity again decline into that whence they have their origin for they must give satisfaction and atonement for injustice each in the order of time.",
  "* There cannot be a single, simple body which is infinite, either, as some hold, one distinct from the elements, which they then derive from it, nor without this qualification. For there are some who make this (i.e. a body distinct from the elements) the infinite, and not air or water, in order that the other things may not be destroyed by their infinity. They are in opposition one to another \u2014 air is cold, water moist, and fire hot\u2014and therefore, if any one of them were infinite, the rest would have ceased to be by this time. Accordingly they say that  what is infinite is something other than the elements, and from it the elements arise.",

But this Earth is isolated in space, and the sky is a complete sphere in the center of which is located, unsupported, our cylinder, the Earth, situated at an equal distance from all the points of the sky."
